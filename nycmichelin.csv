Some two and a half hours later you leave this stunning restaurant feeling joyously replete but also with some regret that it’s all over. There are tables around the edge of the attractive room but sitting at the walnut counter watching the focused and practiced movements of the team is an integral part of the experience. Everyone is served at the same time by a smart black-suited team who prove that when service is really good, you barely notice it. Chef César Ramirez’s cooking is an almost subtractive form of cuisine, with the emphasis on allowing the natural flavors of ingredients to come through. The 13 or so small but perfectly formed dishes confirm a chef at the height of his powers as there is nothing showy or extraneous here. It’s just an absolute meticulousness in ensuring that the key ingredient, whether that’s a Scottish langoustine or A5 Wagyu beef from Miyazaki, delivers its true essence. The sauces, which are of extraordinary depth, play their part in this.","o"

                                     • Japanese","There is a spartan appearance to this sushi temple, where honey-toned bamboo slats are by far the warmest decorative feature. Reservations require confirmation and punctuality, but to sushi-loving diehards, this is just the cost of admission. Avoid the tables packed with suits (this is midtown, after all) and request a seat at the sleek counter—it’s where the magic happens. Your experience here depends entirely on the soft-spoken, attentive and very focused itamae working before you, as his signature style will guide your meal. Their mission is to ensure that each diner receives a wide variety of fish that has just been cut, formed and dressed moments before it is eaten. The kitchen lives up to its hype by ignoring new wave trends in favor of serving classically assembled and spectacularly pristine sushi. Every item is handled with the utmost care, especially the progression of sashimi highlighting the ample textures of mackerel, tuna and salmon. Outstanding clams and scallops are seasoned with a touch of lemon and sea salt flakes to enhance their natural taste; while nigiri featuring Maine and Japanese uni tastings underscore the subtle differences in flavor.","m"

It's also an ideal place to convene with friends over exquisite nibbles and quenching cocktails; and regardless of how loud it gets, there is an infectious, omniscient spirit that encourages diners to linger. Maybe that’s because the talented chef behind this operation, Ignacio Mattos, is unfaltering and impressively consistent in his creative renditions of such bold and iconic dishes as ricotta dumplings with mushrooms and Pecorino Sardo. The menu goes on to offer an array of shareable plates that changes regularly, but if you spot that delightful risotto special, jump on it and worry about the calories later. Dinner might kick off with perfect, sashimi-grade tuna accompanied by woodsy black trumpet mushrooms and elevated by a smooth and tart mirin-soy sauce. Your meal may then hit a crescendo, thanks to dramatically plated fried arroz negro scattered with tender squid and hazelnut-studded romesco. A soft and custard-y panna cotta decked out with vinegar, honey and smoked sea salt brings this enticing series of events to an exalted end.","m"

Once inside, find yourself being guided gently by a member of staff to your seat at the L-shaped counter where you’ll be then greeted with that most heartening of questions: “Do you drink alcohol? ” Yes, this is a bar counter, not a kitchen counter—so instead of having a gaggle of diligent chefs beavering away in front of you, you’ll be faced with what for some is the far more appealing sight of seductively illuminated bottles of Japanese whisky and cut-glass tumblers. As soon as you’ve been served the house cocktail of the day, the kaiseki-style meal commences. This cuisine is nominally Japanese but Chef Sam Clonts’ cooking is unfettered by tradition and puts all his experience reaped at the illustrious Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare to good use. The most striking element here is that these dishes are burnished with a roll-call of exceptionally luxurious ingredients, as might be evidenced by the golden Osetra caviar in the temaki, or the A5 Miyazaki rib-eye couched in the Hokkaido milk bread. The kitchen’s largesse will leave a lasting impression.","m"

Owners Junghyun Park and his wife Ellia not only serve the most exquisite multicourse menu, but have also created a truly beautiful space inside this Gramercy brownstone in which to enjoy it. This becomes quickly apparent, as you’re led into the lounge for pre-prandial drinks and snacks before being seated at the three-sided, 14-seat counter—that enormous care has gone into every detail, from the colors and the uniforms to the chopsticks and the bowls. Competing with all this style and elegance could be a challenge but the food is equally memorable. Dishes are delicate, yet satisfying and display extraordinary finesse and detail. The banchan alone will alert you that something special is happening here and whether pickling, curing, fermenting or grilling it’s apparent this is one with a mastery of all techniques. And the ingredients, be it Australian abalone, Hokkaido uni or Wagyu from Miyazaki are equally exemplary. To supplement the already charming service, custom-designed cards explaining the make-up of each dish and the inspiration behind it are presented with each course.","n"

This Japanese vegan restaurant serves shojin cuisine based on the precepts of Buddhism—if you’re in search of an antidote to the plethora of steakhouses in the city, this is it. The traditionally decorated space on the second floor is a sanctuary of peace and tranquility and offers table or counter seating and service that is as charming as it is earnest. Such is the skill of the kitchen you’ll forget in no time about the absence of fish or meat. It’s all about balance, harmony and simplicity—and allowing the ingredients’ natural flavors to shine, whether it’s the delicate onion soup with mizuna and potato, or the visually arresting hassun which could include everything from mountain yam to burdock root. Your period of contemplation and newfound respect for your fellow man may come to a juddering halt when you find yourself back on Lexington but, for a few moments at least, you’ll feel you connected with nature.","m"

This is not the place where you should order by pointing vaguely at the menu—that way lies trouble because you may find yourself having to re-mortgage your apartment to pay for the 250 grams of Osetra caviar you’ve just inadvertently requested. Best leave that section of the carte to the oligarchs and retired dictators and concentrate on the main menu. Here you will find contemporary dishes of surprising delicacy and precision, with a pleasing bias towards wonderful seafood and shellfish, such as scallops with ricotta gnudi or delicious bluefin tuna with uni and asparagus. You get buzzed in at street level, which adds a bit of mystery to proceedings. Up the stairs and you’ll find yourself in a lavish little jewel box, with colorful murals on the wall, Murano chandeliers hanging from an ornate ceiling, and semi-circular booths. The only thing missing is James Bond’s nemesis drumming his fingers on the table in the corner. For more plush fun in the sun, there is a seriously posh outpost at The Four Seasons Tower in Miami.","m"

Buried into a corner of a gleaming condo tower designed by Foster & Partners, this gorgeous, light-filled space is truly a verdant vision—with olive-green velvet furnishings, green-veined marble flooring and lush plants at every turn. It’s the perfect effect for the chef's equally produce-driven menu, where seasonal vegetables, fruits and herbs play a prominent role—with impeccably sourced meats and sustainable fish as their supporting cast. Diners are welcomed with an ""amuse-juice; "" cocktails feature vegetables and herbs; and even the ice cream is plant-based. Dinner highlights however include Maine sea scallops, seared to perfection before being enhanced with a carrot purée, snap peas, and grilled spring onion. A perfectly cooked whole lobster may then arrive, expertly sliced from its shell and served with a foamy bisque as well as tender, colorful potatoes smoked over cherry wood. Save room for Pastry Chef Salvatore Martone’s intricate and delicious desserts, like a lemon tart with crispy meringue.","m"

The mini space is hardly enough to contain his talent, but the deeply intimate vibe feels very downtown and tuned in. Cleary chef driven, dishes here flaunt focus and style while utilizing a host of global ingredients. To wit—Arctic char is set in a bright orange parsnip beurre blanc and topped with pickled kohlrabi for a visually arresting combination; while a parfait of foie gras is enriched with pistachio crumbles and cranberry crackers. Then it's on to such creative plates as a celery root cappuccino bobbing with tender lobster; or Shigoku oysters with just the right pop of sweet and spicy nam jim. A spiced caramel parfait with rosemary-apple compote is delightfully tart and textured, and should be tailed by the Japanese Tea Service, unveiling cups of delicate green tea accompanied by mignardise. Budget-conscious diners should opt for the tasting menus, which offer a curated list of dishes at good value.","m"

The room is sleek, modern and flaunts a handsome Japanese sensibility—there is a counter for 12, along with three small tables, as well as a relaxed but deeply attentive staff to help enhance the experience. Soft piano music plays in the background, and the crowd is energetic and warm. Chef Kousaka often prepares each item of the omakase himself, methodically working pieces of fish into something transcendent, and explaining them in full to the bright-eyed patrons. The impressive 15-piece version can be tailored somewhat as diners can opt for sushi only or sushi with sashimi, as well as such luxe supplemental items as uni, toro, king crab and ankimo (monkfish liver). Here, fish is minimally embellished, relying instead on original sourcing and the chef’s impeccable technique. For instance, a night’s parade churned out of this kitchen may include everything from red snapper, Japanese sea bass and silky shrimp, to wild winter yellowtail, firefly squid with sweet miso and tosazu jelly, as well as mackerel with ginger and scallion.","m"

There is a stirring attention to detail in every course offered here. Dishes showcase everything from seasonal product impeccably treated and thoughtfully garnished, to nuanced flavor combinations. Classical French techniques underpin the cooking, although you’ll come across subtle influences of a more global heritage, including yuzu with sea urchin, or chipotle with shrimp. Desserts are more elaborate and the ingredients come from the luxury end of the counter. Like walking through Business Class on your way to First, you have to pass through the appealingly buzzy Nougatine to get to this restaurant. The low-slung chairs and large tables mean you need a certain confidence in your conversational delivery if you want to entertain the whole table. If you’re here on a date, which many appear to be, you could find yourself sitting side-by-side—the new orthodoxy of dining à deux.","n"

Each element just works so well here: from the judicious lighting that makes everything feel more sensual, to the music (never too intrusive but far from anodyne) and the delightful servers who appear ninja-style from nowhere to be at your side when you need something. Completed dishes are handed over by the culinary team, who may have perfected the bad boy/girl looks of the modern urban cook, but speak with unalloyed pride when they describe what you’re about to eat. Flavors are refined yet assured, innovative yet expertly balanced, as in the buttery dry-aged Elysian Fields lamb basted in a fish liver and anchovy sauce. Tarte Tatin is brilliantly reworked with mandarin oranges and goat's milk Gouda shavings to offset the bitterness of the rinds. For those with less time to spare, Ko Bar isn't just a pass-through on the way to the main space. It's an entirely new way to experience the main kitchen's eats. It's also an about-face to Ko's tasting menu, as you can pop in and order à la carte.","n"

Fortunately, the three-sided counter here at Atera is large enough to ensure you’re sufficiently far from your fellow diners as well as a certain level of privacy while still letting you enjoy the communal, immersive experience. Things are certainly more grown-up and a little less rock-n-roll here than in similarly styled places: there’s barely a tattoo in sight and the soundtrack appears to have been chosen by someone who doesn’t care that much for music. But, it is needed because there can be pauses in conversation when everyone is facing forward. Danish chef Ronny Emborg and his team serve up a nightly menu of around 20 courses, progressing from the light and subtle to the rich and robust. There may be plenty of tweezer action from the chefs as they plate up their beguiling creations, but they know that there’s nowhere to hide when food is this precise and delicate. Dishes also deliver on the promise that their beauty suggests, whether that’s the creamy scallop with crisp celery or the succulent loin of lamb with snap peas.","n"

As envisioned by Chef/owner Douglas Kim, the kitchen specializes in ramyun—not ramen. The dining space mixes old West Village charm with tidy minimalism for a casual, hip and convivial hangout. Pick your perch at one of the generously spaced tables, or (preferably) at the engaging counter where you can watch each dish come together. If that doesn't have your taste buds tingling, the kitchen's concise number of unique items at a steal of a price will hit the spot. Persian cucumber kimchi with a spicy plum dressing, shiso and sesame seeds is a culinary delight, while the mouthwatering aroma of pork bone broth that precedes the arrival of gochu ramyun brimming with curly noodles, bean sprouts and pickled cabbage is a veritable thesis on ace ingredients. Pyunche salad mingling sushi-grade amberjack dabbed with chimichurri and crunchy vegetables is a simple yet delicious wonder. Not far behind is the surprising toro ssam bap highlighting the eponymous fatty fish with scrambled egg, tobiko and toasted seaweed.","m"

The hip locale is the cherry on top for a fan base, who know just what to expect: excellent cuisine, steep prices and the best pommes purée your palate has ever been privy to. This sleek and sultry space dons an ultra-modern design that features the signature red-and-black color scheme, as well as a pristine open kitchen. Centered around a glossy cherry wood counter, the dining room draws inspiration from those convivial sushi and tapas bars; it also offers an up close and personal view of the cooks in action. As expected, the iconic cuisine is every bit as luxurious as one might imagine. Lavish ingredients like foie gras, truffle and caviar aren't just accents here, but stellar components of many plates. The carte may feel intimidatingly long at times, but the prix-fixe is an easy way to sample sea bass with a fennel broth and sea urchin; or spiced Long Island duck with young turnip and rhubarb confit. The breads are baked by the in-house boulanger, so save room for these gorgeous crumbs.","n"

That same sense of history pervades the entire space, which highlights plush banquettes, impressive ceramics and glittering chandeliers. Was the striking tiled-floor inspired by a certain restaurant scene in The Godfather? Indeed. Mid-century classics are what this menu is all about, but exalted ingredients, skill and presentations will excite even the most cynical savant. Stylish servers—who work the floor with a little flirt and lot of flair—remain in character while presenting top antipasti like crusty garlic bread, soppressata and fresh, particularly divine olive oil-dunked mozzarella. Spaghetti alla gricia may be simple but dazzles just the same, and chicken scarpariello in a garlicky crumb coating dolls up traditional red-sauce cooking with a chunky stew-like sauce with peppers and mushrooms. Though the prices here are jaw-dropping, all is forgiven after one bite of the drool-worthy, six-layer blackout cake.","m"

The state-of-the-art kitchen allows the team to grow into its full creative potential—both in the dining room and at the buzzy bar. But for a truly special experience, book the chef's table (complete with a multi-course tasting menu) inside the kitchen. Chef Abram Bissell and crew are wowing these globe-trotting patrons with excellent food and warm, well-timed service. Appealing dishes showcase clean flavors and may include roasted cauliflower with crab butter, almond-cauliflower purée and crabmeat. The juicy milk-fed pork from Québec is enriched with wine and butter for a gloriously decadent treat. Banana bread pudding with Armagnac crème anglaise comes encased in a chocolate cylinder and is topped with banana ice cream for a treat that will leave you with sweet dreams.","n"

This intimate, sophisticated space is as popular as ever and the team clearly shares the chef's passion and pride. The “farm to fork” mantra may be something of a cliché today, but this chef demonstrates that the startlingly obvious equation of great seasonal ingredients equals great food remains the cornerstone of every serious restaurant. A majority of ingredients come from Stone Barns Center in Westchester County and the eponymous farm in Massachusetts. Diners decide between a six-course “Farmer’s Feast” tasting or a four-course “Daily Menu. "" Dishes are described in refreshingly terse terms to reflect the relative simplicity of what’s on the plate, whether that’s parsnip grits with a jammy egg yolk or Montauk black bass with dill purée.

This neo-classical citadel of Gallic sophistication will certainly impress your guests—the tables are impeccably dressed and a battalion of immaculately groomed staff runs it. They add some nice touches, like presenting you at the end of dinner with your own printed menu, as well as a box of canelé to take home for your doorman or babysitter. If you’re a two, do express a preference for which type of table you want—sitting side by side instead of opposite each other isn’t for everyone. The main menu comes with a choice of six dishes per course, or you can take the decision-making out of the process altogether and go for the seven-course tasting menu with its wine pairings. The cooking is classically French but not rigidly so. That being said, there are no jarring flavors that can sometimes blight ambitious cooking. This is certainly a kitchen with lots of technical skill: the partridge and quail pithivier with black truffle and spinach is a cleverly layered creation, while the dark chocolate and cranberry bavarois is a construction that recalls the works of M.

There’s even a small bar, which means you don’t have to time your arrival to the dot but can gather first for a cocktail. Chef Shigeyuki Tsunoda undertakes his duties with calm, unhurried efficiency and his omakase—in contrast to the surroundings—is rooted in tradition. Before the Edomae-style nigiri come various snacks that are especially enjoyable when paired with something from their broad range of nihonshu. A seasonal soup and creamy chawanmushi with generous spoonfuls of both Hokkaido uni and Osetra caviar are followed by tender abalone, rich red bonito, succulent scallop, and other mouthfuls of delight. The nigiri is an easy-to-eat size and the rice is body temperature so its flavor really comes through.

Service is attentive, the linens are thick, chargers are monogrammed with a goldleaf “F” and every last detail is very, very lovely. As one might expect of a Michael White restaurant, the menu boasts of Italian favorites mingled with contemporary flair. Pastas are masterful, so begin with thin spaghetti tossed in a chunky tomato sauce infused with garlic, scallion, spicy chili and sweet crabmeat. Fish courses can be even more enticing—try the Atlantic halibut crowned with yellow squash and purple radishes or a plate of aromatic bouillabaisse.

The menu explores the area where Italy and France meet—along the border regions of Liguria and Provence—by way of three- four- or five-course meals. The chef's skill truly shines when he puts his practiced hands to perfect house-made pastas tossed in luxe ingredients, like garganelli verdi or risotto studded with meaty blue foot mushrooms and Piave Vecchio. Seafood is particularly well-executed here, as in the black bass with escargots in a garlic-parsley-and butter sauce, or the raw scallops with pickled and sweet kohlrabi with a hint of heat from mustard oil and a smoky pop from the roe. Strawberry sorbet topped with whipped crème frâiche tastes of childhood summers and cleanses the palate.

The room of course is as unchanging and calming as a river stone, set amid blonde hinoki wood and a gargantuan forsythia tree. Yes, you’ll forget it’s on the fourth floor of a mall. Attention to detail is unsurpassed and at times it may seem like a bit much, but a reverential spirit is part of your meal here. Service displays the same smooth grace, with servers at-the-ready carrying their hot towels, fingerbowls, tea and bits of insight. Awaken the palate with a sweet chunk of hairy crab meat dressed in citrusy yuzu beneath creamy tomalley. This may be followed by the chef’s signature glass coupe of minced toro and a very fine—and very generous—pile of Osetra caviar. Maine uni is downright wondrous, served in its shell with caramelized custard and paper-thin, melting sheets of white truffle.

The menu is divided into headings of “Almost raw,” “Barely touched” and “Lightly cooked,” but don’t be fooled, these product-driven items have considerable depth. Seafood restaurants have no hiding place when it comes to cooking fish or crustaceans and this kitchen always hits its marks—whether that’s poaching halibut, pan-roasting monkfish, baking striped bass or searing tuna. While seafood remains Ripert's passion, his vegetarian tasting menu makes waves with dishes like the Himalayan morel, spring pea and fava bean casserole or the warm artichoke panaché with vegetable risotto and Périgord black truffle vinaigrette.

It is also here where a concise list of omakase options is prepared, but regardless of which you choose, these fillets are bound to impress.

Once you’ve been welcomed by the charming team, the somewhat incongruous feeling of riding an escalator up to such a place will soon be forgotten, as will the Time Warner Center itself. However, even with those stunning cityscape views afforded by the large windows—and the clever design of the room whereby all tables get to look out—your attention won’t stray far from the plate in front of you. Such is the appeal of the dishes. There are two tasting menus, one of which is vegetarian. They do offer alternatives using extra-lavish ingredients at eye-wateringly expensive supplements but unless you’re richer than Croesus, you really needn’t consider them as the “standard” dishes provide all the flavor and luxury you’ll need. Just put yourself in the chef's hands and enjoy a meal that is balanced, varied and as seasonal as it gets. The kitchen’s sourcing is legendary and will make you think again about ingredients you consider familiar. For instance, the milk-poached poularde is so exceptionally succulent and flavorsome that any chicken you subsequently sample will seem a disappointment.","o"

Chef Daisuke Nakazawa’s reputation is formidable, which works as a contrast to the jovial banter between the itamae from behind the counter. It simply elucidates the fact that this is a team who loves their craft and is happy to perform for their guests—perhaps using a live wriggling prawn for a bit of a spectacle. Discover flavorful and fatty cuts of fish available here at a more palatable price point compared to many of the city’s other notable sushi counters. Chef Nakazawa’s signature style combines supremely tender fish with perfectly seasoned rice, a spark of wasabi and judicious brush of nikiri for consistently excellent results. One night, for instance, may feature a spectrum of sushi from Hokkaido cherry salmon to live Massachusetts sea scallop with citrus and salt. Then move on to outstanding uni, and finally, a handroll of fatty tuna chopped so fine that it almost seems emulsified. Keep in mind that these chefs are always happy to adjust sizing based on each diner’s liking.","m"

Envisioned by owner Derek Feldman, the sushi bar is headed up by master chef Eiji Ichimura, who prepares a culinary experience for up to 20 lucky diners nightly. A sharply suited host ushers guests into an elegant space decked out in shades of gold. Designed by Scott Kester, walls are lined with textured coverings and the pale wood counter is armed with ten sienna-orange leather chairs. There are no tables and only two seatings per night—at 6:00 and 9:00 P. M. —ergo, it’s important to be punctual as the first meal ends with just enough of a break to give the chef some time to set up for his second session. A night in this master’s presence is thrilling. The grit and noise from the outside will start to dim just as the soothing space and exquisite dishes begin to envelop you. Noodle-like baby squid is served in ponzu with a pinch of grated daikon for ace flavor, while slices of octopus are arranged with leeks and mustard for textural excellence. A delightfully savory monaka combining toasted nori, king crab and Hokkaido uni makes for a luxurious mouthful.","n"

The space is comfortable and streamlined, while the atmosphere feels grown-up and animated. When it comes to service, the well-appointed and smiling brigade glide about the room seamlessly. But really, everyone is here for the food—and that food is very good indeed. Chef Markus Glocker’s cooking is precise and his dishes look quite delicate on the plate. But like a good featherweight they pack more of a punch than you’re expecting. An umami-rich broth may arrive with beautifully shaped caramelle stuffed with shallots, herbs and morels; but, also consider the Arctic char, gently laid over a pool of caramelized onion soubise and accompanied by deep-fried asparagus. Completing the skills of this fine kitchen are such unexpected seasonal treats as an English pea parfait with rhubarb consommé and white asparagus. Discerning palates might even notice the chef's Austrian roots—as evidenced by the likes of short rib and tafelspitz terrine, or Granny Smith and sweetbread strudel.","m"

Just head downstairs and admire the meats hanging in the aging room. If that doesn’t have a Pavlovian effect on you, nothing will. The space also breaks the norm in its looks; it's dark, moody and atmospheric. And while better suited to a group than a date, it is still a restaurant for which people dress up. There’s a comprehensive wine list too, which, if you look close enough, offers nuggets of value. (Downstairs is their ersatz speakeasy, Undercote. )First-timers should head for the “Butcher’s Feast” where you’ll get four different cuts of beef and a luscious egg soufflé that’s a meal in itself. This is accompanied by enough banchan and stews to cover your table and appetite. The USDA Prime meats are first presented raw for you to admire their marbling and color. Your server then rubs the smokeless grill with oil before expertly cooking them. The supporting cast of accompanying flavors—from the kimchi to the ssamjang—are all there to enhance their succulent and persuasive flavor even further.","m"

It's all evidence of Chef Daniel Humm’s masterful precision that extends through the cuisine as it artfully unfolds before each guest. Cocktails are a must and the program features expertly crafted sips highlighting a range of botanicals including green tomato, yuzu or sesame. The Manhattan Cart tempts diners with a bespoke version of the classic cocktail prepared tableside. The menu beams with impressive creativity, as in snails roasted in a bundle of young lettuce; and duck lacquered with honey and lavender. Classic New York remains a noteworthy theme as displayed by a smoked sturgeon-topped savory cheesecake with a bagel crumb crust that pays homage to the city's appetizing shops. Specialties arrive by trolley, perhaps bearing a shaved truffle-topped flatbread brushed with aged-cheddar sauce, which when removed goes on to reveal stuffed wild mushrooms in an intense broth. Desserts, like the Meyer lemon, black sesame and yogurt composition, are utterly modern.","o"

The suited servers glide seamlessly through the dining room, and the overall design of Aquavit remains clean and contemporary. The cuisine is as refined as its Nordic presentations are modern and beautiful—expect glazed earthenware, slate platters and wooden boxes. Opt for the namesake aquavit—offered in house-infused flavors like anise-caraway-fennel or fig-cardamom—to team with such appetizers as a seaweed tartlet with mussel cream and malt gel or Scandinavian sausage slider on a toasted potato bun. This kitchen does many things well, but what makes it one of the more unique is its ability to take bold Scandinavian flavors like dill, lingonberry, smoke, or brine and soften them into balanced, whimsical, and elegant dishes. Take for example, the house-cured salmon, with its dramatic presentation thanks to the fog created by its pear granité “snow; "" or crispy-skinned duck with a perfectly pink interior, black truffle, apple shavings, and a drizzle of black truffle duck jus poured tableside.

The ethos that has made the cooking in Scandinavia so influential—fierce adherence to seasonality and respect for nature’s larder—may not seem particularly groundbreaking but for many a chef and restaurateur it prompted some sort of epiphany. The good news is that, thanks to the great Dane Claus Meyer, you don’t need to fly there to find out more. Agern is hidden at the Vanderbilt Hall end of Grand Central Terminal but has been designed with such understated elegance that you quickly forget where you are. The restaurant also leads into the Nordic-themed “Great Northern Food Hall” so go ahead and embrace the hygge. Ingredients like havgus, söl, and ymer may not exactly roll off the tongue but Icelandic chef Gunnar Gíslason uses them, along with pickling, smoking, and fermenting, to deliver sharper, more defined, and more natural flavors. Mackerel is finessed with bright nasturtium purée and tart tomato salad, while the richness of the dry-aged duck rillettes is balanced with bitter charred cabbage.","m"

There’s a gorgeous blonde wood sushi bar in the back, while gentle jazz music plays in the background. It's all very appealing and particularly serene. Service is excellent, and begins at the door as they whisk away your belongings. These waiters have an eagle eye for detail, managing to be so unobtrusive that you’re able to enjoy intimate conversation. You can choose from multiple options—pick from a wide variety of fish à la carte or leave it up to the talented chef by going with the fixed-price omakase. Either way, you’re in for a culinary treat. The quality and seriousness of the kitchen remain excellent with each passing year, turning out exquisite dishes like pearly cod fillet, a boundary-pushing dish that is very memorable.

Beyond this, the space has a row of tables where you might observe a group indulging in a tuna rib that appears large enough to have come from a cow: first sliced raw, then cooked to enjoy this incredible fish both ways. Unlike the monastic atmosphere often found elsewhere, the mood here is celebratory and upbeat. The service team is swift and friendly even as they work in the shadow of their master. Kanoyama’s omakase is really the only way to experience Chef Shikanai's artistry. It's also profoundly personal, as he displays each morsel with cupped hands, to be taken with your fingers. Pieces are precisely crafted yet delicate and very beautiful in that traditional Edomae style. Overall, the meal is a progression from light and firm fish to vivid and buttery salmon and toro, with exciting stops along the way, including cherry trout hakozushi (box-pressed) or jackfish with grains of Icelandic sea salt and a drizzle of lemon.

Tucked along the eastern edge of Spring Street, the dining room is den-like. A vibrant crowd keeps the place popping all night, as does the gentle stream of Thai pop music in the background. Though tables are mini, the kitchen feels immense in its creative vision—a window into where the magic happens offers views of a slow-rotating rotisserie and crackling embers. Danzer and Redding’s offerings are certainly rooted in this nation’s cuisine, but they give each dish a unique spin thereby infusing vibrant flavor into small plates, large plates, “charcoal-grilled goodies,” desserts and drinking snacks. Laab neuh gae is a spicy chopped lamb salad with a wonderfully sour dressing; and Thai-style blood sausage cooked in banana leaf has an intriguing flavor. For an epic end, go for grilled pork jowl, topped with watermelon radish, salted duck yolk and a shake of sawtooth herb. The 12-seat Uncle Boons Sister on Mott Street is equally popular.","m"

Patrons linger late into the night amid plush velvet chairs and custom chandeliers, enjoying exceptional service and a view of the bustling open kitchen. This menu is unapologetically French, though Rose infuses his classics with a strong dose of personality, making powerful traditional dishes that may have fallen by the wayside relevant again. For instance, a selection of “gourmandises” (or more indulgent delicacies) showcases such exemplary classics as pike quenelles or sautéed sweetbreads. The latter achieves prominent flavor when paired with tomato crème, and may be tailed by beef cheek and foie gras terrine in a pitch-perfect sherry vinaigrette. In closing, a venerated rabbit dish is exceptional under the chef’s lead, presented as three acts: gently braised legs in a clear consommé with an array of vegetables; stuffed saddle drizzled with a rustic pan sauce; and the rest matched with delicious mustard-enrobed onions.","m"

One reason for its continued popularity is that Daniel Humm, of Eleven Madison Park, presides over its restaurant. In contrast to the illustrious flagship, the cooking here is less intricate and more approachable, but still undertaken with considerable skill. Attempting “variations” of Brussels sprouts would be quite a reach for many a chef, yet here demonstrates a kitchen’s ability to turn the ordinary into the sublime. While whole-roasted poulet with black truffle and foie gras is a clear signature, the menu also offers an impressive take on vegetables—as seen in the wonderfully ripe tomatoes with marinated peaches. Accompanying it all is a terrific wine and cocktail list, as well as a dedicated repertoire of mocktails. To be in the heart of the action, ask for a table in the glass-ceilinged Atrium, even though it can be something of a thoroughfare for those going to the adjoining bar. The Parlour, true to its original meaning, is the better choice for diners who want their conversations to involve less bellowing and more privacy.","m"

Seating is either intimate or cramped, and the music is lively or loud, all depending on your mood. Enthusiastic servers add to the room’s energy. Offering eight courses (a cheese option is extra) for just under $100, their prix-fixe is renowned not just for its ambition but also for value. While the menu format may be fixed, dishes change frequently to reflect the young chefs’ wide-ranging talents and contemporary flair. This kitchen really plays it up, presenting textures and ingredients in unusual, but appealing ways. Case in point? The skate, perfectly creamy and set over a surprisingly savory and tart sauce of pickled blueberries, green olives and parsley. The heartbreakingly tender Wagyu topped with chamomile-flavored butter alongside porcini-stuffed cabbage is another winner. Dessert is serious here, as seen in the Meyer lemon, cashew, sweet milk parfait. It's likely you won't recognize any names on the wine list, hyper-focused on natural winemakers. Sip from a similar list and nibble on signature snacks next door at sibling Wildair.","m"

Despite a clandestine vibe and handful of seats, the dining room buzzes with eager diners and locals in-the-know. Low lighting creates a sultry aura and a brigade of courteous servers attends to the pristine 14-seat counter with ease and enthusiasm. The space feels particularly intimate and private—and is perfect for a romantic tryst. Plush leather seats, a gleaming open kitchen and top-notch fittings hint at a classic and celebratory meal. The kaiseki follows a distinct format by starting with a seasonal small plate to precede soup, a grilled dish and fried preparation. Sushi, like fluke with yuzu kosho or aged squid with grated bottarga, is an added bonus on the menu, which mostly features ingredients that are procured locally and presented artfully. Get started with sakizuke, perhaps featuring broccoli rabe and fried taro with seared Long Island unagi tossed in a sesame dressing. Then move on to an intensely flavorful owan, soup course, with Alaskan king crab and turnip; or yakimono of grilled duck breast deliciously balanced by frothy apple cream and sansho-soy sauce.","m"

Behind the soft and silky wood counter, with seating for just eight, stands the confident figure of Chef Shion Uino. He looks young because he is young, but then again he started early and garnered over eight years’ experience at the highly garlanded Sushi Saito in Tokyo before setting sail for NYC. His experience is evident in the number of dishes served before the nigiri, which may include creamy uni from different regions of Japan; delicious hairy crab served in its shell; steamed scallop wrapped in nori; and tender abalone. When it comes to the nigiri, the chef also shares his alma mater’s attention to detail and insistence on consistency. Each piece is given just a light brush of nikiri so that the focus remains on its natural flavor, whether that’s the silvery kohada, luminous white squid or the golden anago. The rice, at slightly above body temperature, leaves a lasting impression. There are two seatings—at 6:00 and 8:30 PM—and as diners are served together it’s important to arrive on time.","m"

This isn’t about abstaining from anything—it’s about savoring. The first clue is the cocktails—not many such restaurants put this sort of thought and effort into their list. At lunch there are even “modestly alcoholic” choices like the very perky plum with Lillet Blanc. At this point you should be nibbling on something from their “first order” part of the menu, such as polenta fries or tandoor bread. The main section is divided between “lighter” and “bolder” dishes, complete with an asterisk highlighting those preparations that can be made vegan. Chef owner John Fraser uses influences from around the world to bring out the individual flavors of his market produce—like sweet hoisin sauce and spicy Thai chili to liven up the shiitake mushrooms, or nori breadcrumbs for the seaweed Caesar. Bright, healthy, fresh, perky and clean are just some of the words that apply here—to the look of the room, the food and indeed most of the customers.","m"

The Asian-inspired menu is truly exciting, for Chen is a master at weaving together a surprising roster of delicious ingredients to craft a uniquely layered dish. Tucked into a quiet street in Alphabet City, this cozy space is decked out with exposed brick walls behind the backlit bar, flower arrangements, and two large wooden-framed bay windows lined with plush purple seating. Service here, not unlike the room, is casual, unfussy and deeply knowledgeable. Don’t miss the crowd-pleasing but totally exquisite chicken liver, matched with maple syrup, toasted milk bread, pepitas and crispy chicken skin. Other noteworthy plates may include a pristine fluke crudo dressed in coconut vinaigrette and paired with micro watercress as well as juicy little cubes of watermelon; or delectably tender octopus with textbook pommes aligot. A dessert of deep-fried buns arrives as a trio of Chinese “beignets” filled with delicious apple jam and accompanied by a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream laced with red bean paste.","m"

For a chef raised in a country famous for its rugged terrain and affinity for game, his contemporary cooking is surprisingly subtle and thoughtful. His warm and inviting dining room fits seamlessly into this neighborhood, with a 20-foot walnut timbered bar and exposed brick walls. Sure, the space is rustic, but in a stunning, well-designed way. Service is relaxed yet practiced, which complements the nature of this food. Chef Lambert’s menu shows a mastery of all modern culinary techniques, and the ingredients are sourced both locally—sometimes as near as the restaurant's back garden—as well as from his motherland. Kick things off with impossibly addictive monkey bread with black Maldon sea salt. Next up, Ora king salmon, its richness counterpoised with apple gel and horseradish espuma. Patùànuku (or Mother Nature in Màori tradition) may then unveil quail with luscious blackberry and bread sauce, followed by Canterbury beef Wellington roasted to pink perfection. Sweet fiends won't be sorry after sampling such complex desserts as passion fruit pavlova, presented as a beautiful meringue filled with fruit curd.","m"

Tempura Matsui is such a place, as it skillfully demonstrates why tempura is a celebrated Japanese cuisine type in its own right. The prized seats are at the counter, especially if you want to see these craftsmen at work. The chefs use a mix of sesame and cottonseed oils; and the gently bubbling pot is refreshed and replenished regularly. Equally important, the batter is used sparingly so that the ingredients taste truly of themselves. You’ll start with a parade of seasonal dishes including tofu with uni, before having some beautifully arranged sashimi. It is then time for the main event, which begins in the traditional way with crispy shrimp legs. The ingredients and fish turned out of this kitchen usually vary according to the seasons, but could include the likes of wonderfully tender squid, succulent Hokkaido scallop, plump matsutake, as well as subtly sweet onion. And be sure to end with tencha, with its mellow, delicious and deeply flavorful broth.","m"

While it may be located on a quiet strip, don't be fooled as there is a palpable buzz within—thanks to the culinary expertise of Chef Nick Curtola and celebrity cachet of owner James Murphy (LCD Soundsystem). Inside, the décor is as minimalist as their succinct menu. Start with chicken liver mousse or the stalwart yellowfin tuna dressed tonnato-style and made bright with yuzu kosho. Montauk scallops cured in a vibrant leche de tigre have a fantastic Thai bent enhanced with the earthy edge of thinly sliced kohlrabi. Just like cultured butter is a perfect companion to warm house-made bread, slices of Bosc pear and salt-baked onion augment beautifully crisped and properly rendered Long Island duck. Let the sociable staff talk you into closing over a quince-and-frangipane tart with citrus whipped cream. This neighborhood gem is laser focused when it comes to wine, so if their wide-ranging, impressive selection has you atwitter, fret not, as it also features half-glasses for abundant sampling. Weekend lunches include a set menu of four small dishes, and at $32, they're a relative bargain.","m"

Designed to resemble a Parisian apartment—hence its name—a meal here feels like attending a dinner party, albeit one with potentially 28 guests. You will be handed a drink as soon as you enter and are thereafter introduced to affable chef, Nicolas Abello. Comprised of everything that its surrounding boulangerie, fromagerie, poissoinnerie and boucherie can offer, it's clear that this kitchen is intent on pushing the barriers of classic French cuisine. The staff is genuinely warm and quite keen to please. From then on, things settle down into a more recognizable format. The set menu kicks off with artistic little canapés that warm up your taste buds. Imagine lobster tartare with dashi gelée or a parmesan- and Chantilly-filled round of pâte à choux. Then it's on to the lineup of dishes, made using all manner of modern technique, like the panko-crusted scallop with beurre blanc; or glazed sweetbreads with shiitake mushrooms and garlic confit. These flavors may be unapologetically rich but are always on point—not unlike the mini praline soufflé matched with praline ice cream.","m"

It is one of those places that manage the rare trick of being so confident in its abilities that it can be all things to all diners. You’ll probably leave happy whether you’re here on a date or to impress the in-laws; whether you’re closing a deal or simply lubricating the thought processes behind one. Members of staff—from the kitchen to FOH—are uncommonly attentive. The “Tavern” side is a prized spot for lunch, especially if you can sit at the bar. Want proof? Look no further than their soup and sandwich lunch special, which is an absolute steal. It doesn’t take reservations, so get here early and join the grown-up queue outside. The “Dining Room” on the other hand is for those who like a little more pomp with their pappardelle and truly comes to life at night. Focused on impeccable products, the seasonal menu is a perfect match for the warm, woody surrounds. This is creative American food sure of its footing and unthreatening in its vocabulary. Selections, like sea bass, pork loin, or even the cheese, display a refreshing sense of restraint, thereby demonstrating the dexterity of this kitchen.","m"

The restaurant shares the same decorative style as sibling Berners Tavern, which is housed inside the London Edition, with high ceilings, handsome wood-paneling and every inch of wall space covered with framed pictures of the good and great. But whereas the London elder is one huge room, this handsome retreat comes divided into three manageable sections, all attended to by a cadre of affable and attentive service staff. There’s a subtle and contemporary British accent to the menu too. Their version of fish and chips takes the national dish to a whole new level, with sweet English peas and triple-cooked chips, while a chutney made from plum and shallots is served with tender roasted Long Island duck and woodsy chanterelles. However, there are other European influences at play, so you may start with a decadent crab and uni risotto, or perfectly done quail and pigeon pie.

It's hard to beat this scene, but the food has its own appeal. Fish and shellfish are the focus of this ambitious, Italian-leaning carte—quality of ingredients and condition play equal parts in their preparation. Nothing commences a meal here like the crudo (and this kitchen offers around 12 to choose from), but other generously sized antipasti, like grilled octopus with smoked potatoes or Nova Scotia lobster paired with burrata offer comfort and flavor. House-made pastas remain a highlight, as seen in the gnocchetti tossed with tomatoes, shrimp, chilies, and rosemary oil. But if you're craving something different, get the spigola striata—or striped sea bass—served with smoky grilled leeks and tender butter beans. As an homage to this kitchen's creative spirit, desserts like the mascarpone panna cotta are augmented by a cashew tuile, huckleberry mostarda and a scoop of prickly pear sorbet.","m"

Then move on to eggplant terrine tucked with a purée of red bell peppers, before closing out over Long Island duck breast set over polenta and paired with pruneaux d'Agen-studded wild rice.","m"

Of course, with neighbors like the Whitney Museum and Chelsea Market, not only is its location desirable, but there is a distinct sense of luxury here as evidenced by their plush tables, polished marble and silk-draped windows. Balconies sit above the striking bar with live piano music pouring through the room. Despite the formality, there is a convivial buzz among patrons as the impressive staff attends to them. Warm and crusty bread with cultured butter (read: crème fraîche-whipped cream) is a melt-in-your-mouth delight, tailed by such indulgent plates as vitello tonnato—chilled, tender veal with silky tuna sauce and a delicate garnish of basil. Then consider the flavor-forward orecchiette tossed with winter chicories, duck sausage, and tart balsamic vinegar. Coffee matched with chestnut panna cotta is all warmth, nuttiness and a denouement that will leave diners speechless. A worthy exception to the all-Italian wine list is a superb offering of some 300 champagnes.","m"

In fact, the city’s branch of this international chain has gone full-on Fifth Avenue, where even the ceiling is of cathedral-like proportions. The 16-seater cypress counter is the focus of the room. Here, particularly at lunch, you’ll find several solitary Japanophiles satisfying their cravings by ordering ten or more pieces of nigiri before scurrying back to their offices. Some of the chefs are more enthusiastic than others when it comes to engaging with the diners seated opposite them, but all work with the same practiced, fluid movements. At dinner, the omakase is a more significant affair—reflected in the prices—where the chefs demonstrate their mastery over a number of different seasonal fish. The koshihikari rice is yuki-tsubaki from the Niigata Prefecture and is seasoned with red vinegar, which makes it quite dark in color. Each piece is simply brushed with nikiri and occasionally some grated yuzu, but on the whole this is about enjoying natural flavors. The impressive selection of nihonshu, presented on an iPad, includes many small producers.","m"

When you do find it, you enter into a stylish, beautifully understated and meticulously laid out room that looks like a page from Wallpaper magazine. It’s run with considerable charm by an unobtrusive and very courteous Japanese team. The two-page menu is easy to decipher with clear headings. However, you might just be better off giving in and letting the chefs decide by going for the balanced and seasonal dishes from the seven- or nine-course omakase. Two things will quickly become clear: the ingredients are exceptional and the technical skills of the team considerable. This is food that is as rewarding to eat as it is restorative. Standouts include the lingering, complex flavors of Kumamoto oysters wrapped in Wagyu beef carpaccio and topped with Maine sea urchin, perfectly grilled Japanese kinki or anything with their homemade tofu. There are tables available, but it’s so much more satisfying to sit at the counter and engage with the smiling chefs—this way, you may even find that there are a few more dishes in their repertoire than they advertise.","m"

Then comes the elegant Suzuki dining room, and finally, reach your goal at Satsuki. This omakase-only counter seats no more than ten guests in an utterly tranquil shrine dedicated to upscale Japanese cuisine. Feasts begin with the presentation of a wooden box, displaying the seafood that will soon become your meal. Each component of this sushi is prepared with paramount care, right down to the blend of vinegars that season the rice. The selection of fish may sound familiar—shrimp, cuts of tuna, uni—but demonstrates the careful craftsmanship of Chef Toshio Suzuki, who spent an age honing his skills at Sushi Zen. A trio of sashimi is served with three distinct sauces for dipping. This is followed by a simmered dish, like braised monkfish liver with sesame salt. When the parade of sushi arrives, each morsel strives to outdo the last. Meals culminate as the chefs coax layers of flavor from petals of Hokkaido uni with a hint of wasabi, wonderfully mild needlefish and fatty tuna from Spain. Handrolls in crisp nori make for a superb conclusion.","m"

Every detail has been painstakingly selected (and imported) to recreate an intimate Japanese refuge and the result is breathtaking. The Ash Room seats seven at the counter and offers a pure expression of seasonal nigiri, while the 200-year-old Hinoki Counter is where Chef Nozomu Abe presides and prepares a tasting menu of small plates in addition to the seasonal omakase. There is a clear element of luxury coursing through the veins of this hideaway. The chef's omakase is considerably impressive, exuding personality and confidence by virtue of product that is expertly aged and handled. Diners are in for a treat as this master seasons rice, deftly slices fish and sears fatty tuna collar under the blazing-hot binchotan. The sushi is masterfully crafted from catch procured directly from Tokyo's Toyosu market and points beyond (imagine the likes of Norwegian crab and Spanish bluefin tuna). Highlights include Kyushu uni, toro take, char-grilled otoro, and the divine egg yolk and anchovy hand roll.","m"

The kitchen is nominally influenced by the Costa Brava, but rest assured that its reach is far greater than that and the tapas are far more sophisticated than they pretend to be. Creamy scrambled eggs with uni is a must; caramelized scallops come with a well-balanced green curry; confit goat will make you question why you don’t see more of it on other menus; and the spiced lamb sausages really pack a flavor punch. This is food to cure what ails you.","m"

With just four marble tables and a small counter, this is as intimate as it gets. But you first have to navigate the bouncer at the door who’ll only allow admittance with a reservation. This at least ensures that, when you’re inside this bijou spot, the door doesn’t swing open every minute. Once in, you’re handed a cocktail list—these are, without doubt, some of the best in town and fully justify the lofty prices. The short seafood menu comes with a couple of choices under headings like “crudo,” “seared” and “ceviche. ” Before you do anything else, order the trout roe on toast—it’s a beautiful thing and will linger long in the memory. This is not the place for everyone. Some won’t see past some of the more pretentious elements and affectations and the prices can be eye-watering—the Chianina beef carpaccio comes in at over $100. However, judicious ordering before you plunge into the cocktails, like having clams instead of caviar, can at least keep your final bill from escalating too wildly. It also helps that the place is run with considerable charm, patience and care.","m"

The gorgeous lobby leads to a clean, sleek and modern dining room, replete with soaring ceilings, polished marble floors and expansive windows. It’s a feast for the eyes, no doubt, but the real star at this buzzy location is the exquisite meal to follow. To call the tender, otherworldly Gruyère fritters a “fritter” at all seems a disservice to the lightly fried choux pastry that arrives, piped with nutty cheese and dusted with lime and chili. An impossibly silky starter of white bean hummus is equally sensational, when paired with warm, fresh puffy pooris and topped with toasted pignoli nuts, roasted herbs and spicy ’nduja. Chef Kent’s menu is thoughtful and meticulously detailed, with an appealing selection of crudo, like charred carrot ""sticks"" set over sliced razor clams and surrounded by a lemon-thyme foam. Pastas and other mains also delight—the latter might entail flaky branzino arranged with green tomatoes and radish; grilled pork chop with Asian pear and mustard; or roasted short rib for two, with braised ends, quinoa and chimichurri.","m"

Crockery and cutlery are notable—the salt cellar even resembles a gilt apple. Service oscillates between professional and relaxed, but it is always efficient—even your bag will have its own rack. Dishes reflect global sensibilities with a strong creative edge. Nowhere is that more clear than in the precisely cut langoustine tartare, topped with a crispy tuile and wonderfully enriched with cauliflower cream. Foie gras arrives in myriad guises, perhaps as a seared lobe as rich as custard, surrounded by roasted quince, chestnuts and vanilla gastrique. Old-school luxuries extend right through to the cheese trolley. A cocktail list dedicated to the history of Bryant Park, which is located across the street, lends a sense of identity to this already impressive room. As an homage to the eponymous chef’s Alsatian heritage, the wine selection prominently features rieslings, pinot blancs and gewürztraminers.

But, not all of us always want loquat with our lunch or dashi with our dinner—sometimes we need something that evokes a sense of place and history and Wallsé provides just that. Those, however, who think Austrian food is all Wiener schnitzel and apple strudel should think again, because this cuisine is itself made up of a host of influences, stretching from Italy all the way to the Balkans. Chef Kurt Gutenbrunner and his kitchen also demonstrate how cuisines can evolve to respect contemporary tastes without compromising their integrity. So while there are plenty of classics on offer at all times, including quark spaetzle with succulent, tender rabbit, there are also lighter dishes like cod with squash and chanterelles. This two-roomed restaurant exudes a sense of romance, so if you’re here on a date go full-on Viennese when it comes to dessert by sharing a Sachertorte. The vivid modern canvases are also a welcome change from the anodyne art found in so many places.","m"

But what is most impressive here is that the Korean elements of the dishes seem to raise them to another level. Bibimbap composed with gochujang, crispy quinoa and tender Wagyu beef tartare will live long in the memory; while the branzino served simply with white kimchi shows that this is also a kitchen with the utmost confidence in the quality of its ingredients. This is cooking that is original, impeccably executed and enormously satisfying. It’s the sort of food that makes you involuntarily nod to yourself while you’re eating. The space is cool, crisp and elegant; the service team sharp, keen and organized. The impressive acreage could make the dining room unwieldy, but it’s divided up into smaller sections so you never feel like you’re rattling around. It also helps that it’s decorated in a sensual and sophisticated way—Jungsik is an immeasurably good looking restaurant, run with the professionalism that its cooking demands.","n"
