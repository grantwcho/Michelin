Chef’s Table is a three Michelin-starred restaurant featuring the cuisine of Chef César Ramirez. Every dish was packed with flavour. There was not a single dish that we didn’t enjoy. The quality of food is also of high nature. Decor and atmosphere is simple but chic. Service was professional and attentive. The whole dining experience was flawless save for what happened at the end. Chef Ramirez was attending the tables and greeting his guests which is our usual gesture at high end restaurants and with well-known chefs. We were surprised that he didn’t pass by our table or greet us. We thought that he may do this towards the end. We asked for the bill and it was obvious that we were not going to meet him. So when we were leaving we asked the waiters every code great chef Ramirez. We were surprised to be told that he is busy in the kitchen doing the ice cream dish! No one even offered to check or ask us if we could wait for him. This left an impression with us at ignoring us was intentional and for reasons that we have no clue for. Obviously we were disappointed but this would not let me rate restaurant less than 5.,Certificate of Excellence2018 - 2019 Winner,48,3,4,2,4,75 reviews,Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare

Hate how they make me wear a jacket. They offer you a suit jacket if you don’t have one, but wearing their jacket would have ruined my evening,
If you want to really surprise your date, bring her here. The front door is literally that of a supermarket’s. Not a food market or fancy food court but literally a supermarket where you buy groceries. And not even a fancy supermarket either. Think neighborhood Keyfood. I believe they can easily move if they want from all the money they are making but it seems to me they enjoy this notoriety. While I don’t really care but the fact they made me dress up in a suit jacket and shoes really piss me off so I’m not laughing because the joke’s on me.
There is no waiting room. It’s better to even come late as most ppl do. Coming in early and you just have to stroll around the supermarket like a dope. Their limited seating forbids them to seat you early unless you’re the first group of the evening.
The bar is huge and I would say it’s better to eat at the bar because the tables are just in the peripheries. The main attraction is definitely the bar facing the kitchen. It’s fancy inside but not that fancy that would warrant a suit jacket. They really should consider removing that requirement along with shoes which I don’t like wearing. Why wear shoes when you can wear comfy casual canvas sneakers? I understand athletic sneakers might be too much, but who is looking at our feet when we are dining? The pretentiousness itself is enough to make me really mad and give them a bad review outright.
The drinks are another issue. Only wine. Pretty much there are no cheap drinks here like beer or soda since this is not included in the precharged price so they want to add another $200 to the already $400 cost. Ouch. Juice is cheapest at $10 or just water thru it.
I thought about removing a star or two but in the end, the food was not just amazing but the best I ever eaten ever. Pretty much every dish was a delight. And there were so many. At the end of the night, I was quite full and very happy.

The service can be stuffy at times and the smiles quite fake but they do their jobs. If you can overlook all the earlier grievances that I stated then it’s quite a spectacular meal for the evening.",Certificate of Excellence2018 - 2019 Winner,48,3,4,2,4,75 reviews,Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare

Service was pleasant - nothing very special for the States though. 
They forgot to serve us the drinks we ordered - but ok - happens everywhere.
Plates are meant to be shared. We shared three dishes. 
All dishes were good beyond any doubt. Nevertheless, we thought that prices are too high for the performance. The handmade pasta was the best dish and recommendable. The lamb was not that good in our opinion. Vert interesting and tasty seasoning, but simply not the best piece of lamb with lots of fat and tissue. 
The starter was good but by no means spectacular- we had lots of better Burrata for less money.

It took me so long to write this review as I really wanted to find the right vernacular to share this crappy experience, but once I saw that Michelin was smoking something to give these guys a star, I said screw it...I'll take one for the team and throw eloquence to the wind.

I was meeting a very dear friend after 4 years and chose to dine here thinking that it would be fuss-free and it had great critical reviews, landing on the Best 50 Restaurants in the 51-100 list. I don't know what Pellegrino is thinking either. I have dined all over the world and there are way better restaurants than this place. Nothing wrong with getting the food ordered - our server was pretty good in explaining the menu and how many entrees would be appropriate for the two of us. But once the food started to come out, I don't know what happened. For a Michelin/Best 50 restaurant, GET THE SERVICE RIGHT!!!! No replacement of the small appetizer plates unless we literally called the staff down, no asking of a replenishment of my water and no replacement of cutlery. The food kept coming out in haphazard fashion. We were told that the food would come out as it is prepared - which is fine - but receiving their critically-acclaimed dumplings 20 minutes after we are done eating everything else? Come on! 

As for the food...it's nothing. I don't even remember what I ate, maybe I choose to block it out of my brain. There is way better food out there - you could probably get better odds circling your finger on a map and pointing blind.

First, the 'restaurant' (should really be called a 'tapas place') is located at East Houston Street between Mulberry and Mott. It is not at an 'exclusive' location. Prepare to be shocked by the unfair portion to price equation: $17 cocktail, $26 black rice. The cocktail was not balanced (I'm still recovering from a headache) and the black rice was miniscule. If you are going for a meal, plan for a $120 budget, drinks excluded. This is simply disrespectful, especially given the size of everything in the menu. For those of us working in the arts/culture sector, Estela is simply a waste of money. Go for it if you are in the 'bling-bling' mood, but otherwise skip and head to any other decently priced and portioned restaurant.

It consists of two small, intimate bars -- the eight-seat Kaiseki bar and the ten-seat Omakase Sushi Bar. We dined in the latter and will be forever grateful that we did.

There is champagne with the opening course and after that the diners choose their beverages which range from fine French wines to elegant Japanese sakes.

So if you are looking for real traditional and classic Japanese Kaiseki, you will found it's a bit disappointed. Since I've read reviews before I visited, my expectation is that I can taste something both westernized and Japanese. So I like their food.

The menu loosely followed the traditional kaiseki format, but with some unusual, and highly successful twists such as the Osetra caviar temaki and the A5 Wagyu sandwich. We enjoyed every one of the 12 courses and felt that the optional wine pairings, a mixture of sakes, European wines and a Japanese whiskey, were well matched to the courses.

Atoboy is my wife and I's favorite restaurant in NYC right now and have been there many times. For context, we occasionally do high end tasting menus, like 2-5 a year.
I would reaaallly like to focus on all of the amazing things Atomix did, but unfortunately there was a fatal flaw - not serving a full meal! My wife is 100lbs and has only finished one tasting menu before, that was a $60 4 course menu downtown. We even had a huge breakfast at 1pm before the 6pm reservation. When we got to Atomix, she was worried that she was not even going to be able to taste 10 dishes. She said she was a 6 or 7 in hunger out of 10.
She ate every bite of food. Literally every bit of banchan. She also had all of the wine, which was also a first. (I think the wine pairings were phenomal though! Great sommelier choices). After the meal was over she said ""should we go get some beer and fried chicken sandwiches?"".
I'm normally a big eater, and will actually eat a snack before these long tasting menus, so I can enjoy the first courses with out being so hungry. I think i was exactly the same fullness after the meal as I was 2.5 hrs earlier. If my wife had said it was too much food for her, then I would probably have given 5 stars (and eaten her left overs). But, to serve a meal that is average sized for a 100lb woman to everyone is crazy. Yes, i would like a full meal for a 200lb adult for my $1,000, not just great tastes and an amazing experience. Even sprang for the extras!
I looked around and every bite was finished by everyone there. I don't know how this hasn't come up more in the reviews!?
The service, taste, decor, experience and wine pairings were 5 stars. I had been looking to come since they announced the restaurant over a year ago. Wish I could remember it for the experience instead of lack of calories.

Atomix (pronounced ah-TOE-mix) is open for dinner on Tuesdays through Saturdays (closed Sundays and Mondays). We booked our spot online one month in advance using the pre-paid Tock reservation system. (For example, March reservations became available on February 1; April reservations became available on March 1, and so on.) This very popular restaurant always sells out quickly. Using Tock (set up an account ahead of time, so that on the day you reserve, you can just select a day/time and press a button), you must pre-pay for the entire meal ($225 per person, which includes tax and gratuity). On the night that you dine, you pay separately for your beverages.
Atomix opened in 2018 in a townhouse on East 30th Street. Upon climbing the steps to the brownstone, we had a difficult time choosing which door to enter (there is no sign or mark indicating behind which door is the restaurant). After picking the correct door, we saw that the first floor contained a bar and lounge area that serves drinks and small plates; you can dine there without a reservation. Below street level (down an elegant set of stairs) is another small lounge area that adjoins the main dining room with its 14-seat rectangular black granite counter. Before being seated for dinner, guests first enjoy some drinks and small bites in a casual group setting, although we arrived too late to partake. Diners are invited to choose a set of chopsticks from the chef’s collection, and other serveware is handmade by artisans in South Korea. Prior to each course, a tunic-clad server places a card in front of each diner that contains a Korean word describing the dish. The back of the card lists the dish’s ingredients. At the end of the evening, the restaurant packages the cards together to take home as a unique souvenir.
Atomix is operated by a husband-and-wife team, JP and Ellia. He (formerly the chef de cuisine at Jungsik, where we dined in August 2017; see our separate review) is the chef, and she manages the front-of-house. The duo also operate the more casual Atoboy (pronounced ah-TOE-boy), located just two short blocks away. (We dined at Atoboy in October 2019; see our separate review.)
Atomix serves a Korean 10-course tasting menu. Before our meal, I ordered a drink called the Samioko, made with tequila, mezcal, grapefruit, lemon, and honey. There were three splashes of sesame oil on top, so when I sipped, I tasted sweetness and immediately smelled the sesame oil. It was ingenious! But onto the food …
• We first received two amuse bouche: a crispy shell filled with crudo and a miniature truffle tart.
• At this point, we were shown some enormous black truffles and asked whether we wanted to add them to any or all of 3 courses (two of them were Jjim [snow crab] and Jorim [wagyu]) for about $20 per plate; although the price seemed reasonable, we passed on the offer).
1. ""Guk"" – maesaengi (seaweed), garlic custard, uni, pork broth
2. ""Hwe"" (Raw)– yellowtail, carrot jang, chojang (sweet chili pepper sauce), perilla leaf
3. ""Jeon"" (Fried) – potato, fermented yuza, herbs, flowers (THIS WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE COURSES)
4. ""Jjim""(Steam) –snow crab, grandada pepper, trout roe, tapioca, white kimchi sauce (ANOTHER FAVORITE)
banchan: gyeranmari (a rolled omelette) with myeongran jeot cream (salted seafood) 
5. ""Twigim"" (Fried)– soondae (blood sausage), gim (seaweed), ssamjang (spicy) dip
banchan: mustard kimchi and cuttlefish
6. ""Sukchae""(Blanched) – celeriac, buttermilk cheese, hazelnut milk, caviar
black rice (which looked purple) with sweet potatoes, ginger, chive (WE DIDN’T LOVE THE RICE SIDE DISH)
7. ""Gui"" (Grilled) –snapper, kohlrabi kimchi, nuruk sauce (ANOTHER FAVORITE)
banchan: parse (seaweed), dubu skin, wasabi (WE DIDN’T LOVE THIS BANCHAN)
8. ""Jorim"" (Braised) – wagyu, fermented red pepper, ginger leaf oil (YUMMO!)
rice: white rice with an assortment of lettuces to eat ssam style (wrapped) (WE LIKED THE UNIQUENESS OF THIS SIDE DISH BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE FLAVOR)
9. ""Ipgasim"" (palate cleanser)– makgeolli (rice wine ice cream), quince, pear, sumac meringue
10. ""Husik"" (Sweet/Dessert) – red bean paste, persimmon, pine nut (WE LOVED THIS BECAUSE WE HADN’T EXPECTED THE BEAN PASTE TO BE WARM)

I am not at all familiar with Korean food and did not know what to expect. It was undoubtedly one of the best meals we have had - the perfect marriage of tastes and textures in each bite was sublime!
The very talented and understated chef JP Park creates ten unique, inspired courses, drawing from Korean ingredients and preparations. Only 14 diners are served at one time, around a u-shaped bar, with two seatings per evening. 
A beautiful card comes with each course, describing the ingredients and origins for the dish. I loved having the background information, although I must admit that many of the ingredients were unfamiliar to me. But the stories about the inspiration for each course were fascinating. 
Each course is also served on beautiful ceramic pieces. The artist’s name is listed on the cards. Diners also select a pair of chopsticks to use at the beginning of the meal. No attention to detail has been spared. 
To begin the meal, diners are given two appetizers (in addition to the ten courses). From the first bite, we knew it would be a special evening. I cannot begin to describe the courses ... several featured seafood including snow crab, caviar, yellowtail, and perhaps my favorite of the evening ... golden eye snapper, with its skin ever so delicately broiled to perfection, served with white kimchi juice and an incredible sauce of fish stock, cream, brown rice vinegar and ginger juice to name a few of the ingredients. Perfection!
There were two sweet courses to finish the meal, one featuring Makegeolli ice cream (from a Korean alcoholic beverage) and the other red bean, persimmon and pine nut. 
Descriptions don’t do the complex dishes justice. You need to be there to experience it. One sublime bite after the other ...
The wait staff feels like family - welcoming and knowledgeable. Ellia Park quietly oversees the dining area. No fuss, no drama, just one truly incredible meal.

You have to get it a month out and fully pay for it though Tock. So needless to say, I've been trying to get a reservation here for a long while. So when I finally got one, I was super excited. 

Let's talk location. It's not far off from ktown and hidden in a residential area. In fact, you may even ring the wrong doorbell. Looking for the Ring smart doorbell and you'll find the correct location. 

You'll be greeted by the hostess and you'll walk through the very modern looking bar. Then you'll proceed down the stairs to the waiting area. The entire space is very reminiscent of your rich friend's loft apartment. 

If you arrive on time, you'll receive your first two snacks in the lounge while you wait for your table. You're seated in a horseshoe shaped bar with generous space in between parties. 

The coursed meal comes out pretty quickly but doesn't feel rushed. Overall the food was unique modern Korean. There were a few misses but overall flavorful. It reminded me a bit of Copenhagen cuisine. 

I think my overall assessment was that it was good but not amazing. I see the appeal but wouldn't necessarily want to go back. The overall experience was great but the food is why I eat out.",null,9,1,1,0,0,13 reviews,Atomix

We were seated in one of the three plush crescent-shaped booths walking in on the right, which made for a comfortable setting to enjoy our evening. The decadence began with each of us getting 50 grams of Gold Osetra caviar along with a supplemental 125 grams of Sevruga caviar to share. The caviar was beautifully presented and served with crème fraiche, chives, potato slices, fresh made blini, toast points, and warm house made potato latkes. The caviar was exceptional. Following the caviar service, house made breads with three different butters (onion, caviar, and cranberry-walnut) were offered – the olive loaf with the different butters was delicious. Moving into the menu proper, we were then treated to a sensational tuna tartare topped with a generous portion of Osetra caviar in a mouthwatering soy-type sauce – just exquisite flavors. Next, a sphere of rich and delicious jelly encased foie gras topped with a nice mound of Burgundian black winter truffles resting on a bed of Sicilian pistachios served with freshly made toasted brioche – just wonderful. Then, a poached egg, topped with a nice portion of caviar in an absolutely sensational creamy parmesan sauce. Followed by tagliatelle pasta with an incredibly generous portion of freshly shaved white Alba winter truffles (the pasta was a tad undercooked, albeit the Alba truffles were exceptional). The final savory course was Dover sole presented and then deboned tableside, also topped with ample freshly shaved white Alba truffles personally shaved by the chef at the table. The dessert was a delicious chocolate ganache cake served with ice cream. Petit fours were also presented. We enjoyed the whole meal with free-flowing Dom Perignon blanc and then a glass of Dom Perignon rose poured to ring in the New Year.

And when each course is more than just one mouthful, the dining experience improves even more.
Fine dining in New York City usually comes at a price. But the prices here at Ukiyo in the East Village for the tasting menus in particular offer exceptional value for money - perhaps because the restaurant is so new, having been open (since late May) less than two months as I write this.
I'd definitely recommend a visit soon just in case prices rise or portions get smaller. Make sure you book: on my Tuesday visit 15 of the 18 seats were occupied.
As you would expect from a fine dining establishment, the dishes combine ingredients in unique ways, providing interesting textures as well as tastes - for example, a foie cocktail with pickled cherries, sakura blossoms and cherry meringue.
The chef and his team prepare the food in the open kitchen across from the dining counter.
Wait service is friendly and efficient.

As soon as you walk through the door, you know you’re in for a treat. From the dimly lit entrance you’re taken to you’re seat at the sushi bar. Everyone has the pleasure of watching the ‘artists’ (truly, that’s what they are) prepare you’re food. 
Since we couldn’t decide on a single item on the menu that we didn’t want to try, we went wild and ordered the 8 course tasting menu. Not only did we get our 8 courses, but a couple of little chefs treats too. One of the treats, an absolutely gorgeous crab dish, was one of my favourite bites of the night.
The thing I love most about this restaurant is the creativity that goes into the food. The combination of flavours and colours make each dish an experience. 
We washed this down with a lovely full bodied red. We usually go with the Tempranillo (similar wine list to Degustation), but instead we went with a Chilean blend that the server recommended. 
Which brings me to the service. We were so happy to see the friendly face of our fave waiter that had been there since we used to go to Degustation. He’s brilliant. Always good recommendations, always very attentive and super friendly!

Only two negatives. First, the server kept mixing up who had which dish; poor management in general and unforgivable at this price point. Second, the entrance was chaotic: nobody could tell if we were booked for the casual section or the main dining room, and nobody was in charge. Fix this please.

This style of prep and cuisine is a dime a dozen now at this level...I wish I had taken the same money, maybe even added a bit more and explored elsewhere. My time was wasted but the mystery is over and I can confidently say that I won't be back here again.

I can away a little confused about the identity of the cuisine: it is definitely not Chinese or Japanese but it is not western either, quite ""Pacific Rim"" and includes a bit of everything. I generally love a Kaiseki concept but the Japanese gives the course more contrast between hot vs cold, raw vs cooked, fried vs steamed; at Ko every dish is about the same temperature and cooked in similar ways.

Food was excellent throughout with some nice innovative courses and some really flavorful dishes throughout the evening. We left feeling quite full and happy.

The service was spectacular - unobtrusive yet still anticipating your needs. The servers are playful and smile, and you can tell everyone is happy to be there. Many of the courses are plated tableside, which adds a great dimension to the experience!
So, why did I dock it a fifth star? While almost all of the dishes were sensational (truly), the two meat courses - well, one poultry and one meat - were a) insufficient and b) the two least exciting courses of the night. The chicken course had good flavor and some fun nuance, but at the end of the day is still chicken; the veal course fell quite flat. It needed salt for sure, but it just lacked the wow factor. In a 15 course tasting menu, I could forgive 1 or 2 courses not be great, but these were the only non-fish/veg courses, so that made it super disappointing. Also, weirdly enough, they have no full bodied white wines by the glass, which is a huge miss and quite puzzling to me. 
I honestly give this place 4.5/5 instead of 4, but since Trip Advisor doesn’t allow half stars, I round down.

Something is not right with him. Don't get me wrong. The food was exquisite; the procession of amuse-bouches will leave an impression in your palate. But the atmosphere destroys what should be a memorable and delightful experience. We are not in a military academy, we are not in a cathedral, we are in a restaurant, trying to relax, attempting to take a break from our daily routine of struggles and ongoing challenges. Please do not put your guests through a stressful atmosphere; you will not lose or get a Michelin star by being uptight and communicating distress. SMILE. It is simple, easy and free; it will take you a long way to be charming with your customers. That is indeed what Atera needs from its chef and the males under his direction: CHARM.

Book a table at l’Atelier Robuchon today before they get their third Michelin star.... while the price for the tasting menu is high like you would expect in such a restaurant, Chef Christophe loves to let incredible products speak for themselves.

For example, I probably would not have ordered the Curry Eggplants and they were really amazing. While we all mourn the death of Chef Joel Robuchon Chef Christophe is making him proud for sure!

The shrimp scampi are $24 per shrimp(yes, you’re reading that correctly). And they’re not even near colossal size. The linguine alle vongole was $42 and if I tried real hard I could probably get the entire entree on 1 fork. It also tasted as if someone dropped it in a salt bowl. Terrible.

They slow down a bit if you order big or go for the $250+ wine list. When we opted for the more reasonable by-the-glass wine, we were pressed repeatedly for our order. Both times, we ordered the most famous items, the veal parm and the spicy vodka rigatoni. We skipped the meatballs this time as that was way too much, opting to split a Caesar. This go round, the rigatoni was very spicy - so much so that my wife couldn’t eat it. They kindly prepared her a half order of another pasta to replace it - which she loved. The veal parm was fine, but it’s $65 or more.

Perhaps this is why the restaurant was packed with NYC Millennials. With 7 dishes shared among our party of 6, none were delectable, none deserved the high prices or any accolades. If you are really interested in quality food, do not dine here. The price gauging is beyond imagination – no wonder Carbone's does not advertise costs on their website. And don’t look towards the wait staff for help. We found our waiter to only suggest the highest cost dishes on the menu. And do you enjoy wine with your dinner? There are only a handful that are under $100. I truly believe the people who dine here and give it high marks have a limited palate and have not idea what fine food is all about.

The entrance is a little different, but very elegant and nice, our welcome was warm, friendly and efficient, the dining room is quite lovely, etc. We had the ""standard"" 4 course prix fixe menu, so between the two of us had 8 different dishes. All were excellent. It is hard to pick what was best...I particularly liked the squab consommé with port and foie gras...but everything we ate was lovely. 
Aside from the food, the service was a standout. It was attentive but not fawning, warm and friendly but not too familiar, efficient but not rushed, etc. 
I was not interested in buying a really expensive wine, so to do something different, I consulted with the sommelier and picked a 37 year old Gigondas (still expensive, at least by my standards, but not over the top) on the theory that while it was most probably well past its prime, it might be something different and perhaps surprising. The sommelier was going to decant it, but after a taste he advised that he didn't think that it would bear up well to decanting. I think he was right, and the wine started out very nicely and got a lot better with time in the glass. The point of telling about this is simply that the sommelier was very helpful and perfectly willing to spend whatever time it took to find the right wine. 
In the course of our meal our main server was very attentive, but we were also served by several others, and were visited by the manager (I think that's who he was), who was checking up to see how our meal was going...impressive in that he not only knew what we had eaten, but what we were having for the courses that were coming up. At the end of the meal we were visited by Daniel Boulud himself, who very graciously stopped by our table for a very nice 5 minute chat. 
I don't think that we got any special treatment...we were just ordinary patrons, and as far as I can tell, everyone got the same gracious treatment and superb service. It was the mark of a really good restaurant.
Of course, Daniel is very expensive, but that was no surprise. And if you want a quick meal, I don't think this is the place. We were in no rush, and I suspect we could have hurried things up if we wanted, but our meal took something like 2 1/2 hours.

Right at the reservation website, you’re instantly charged $300. And at this price point, it must be perfect.
The ambiance is quite fancy once you can find the place. It’s quite hidden so there is someone outside to greet you in case you can’t find it. What’s confusing is a few stores down, there is another Omakase in plain view which I am thinking of trying. The storefront there definitely looks better. Here, there is no storefront and you have to be guided to a labyrinth which takes you to the restaurant. Basically, this used to be someone’s apartment.
The waiting lounge is nice and quite fancy. They won’t let you forget you are in a fancy place with everyone dressed formally in business suits and the bar is the type you see in James Bond movies. The dinner did not start in time and we had to wait about 10 minutes before we are escorted to the main dining room.
The main dining room can seat 9 ppl but depending on the night, they will take some chairs away and on this night, it was less than capacity which means more elbow room. The chairs are quite plush and comfy. Possibly the most comfy Omakase seats I ever sat on. The decor is a nice blend of traditional mixed with contemporary. As with most Omakases, there is never a window around and so it’s the usual stuffiness. Make no mistake, the counter is quite expensive and made of quality wood and the old-styled lantern light covers add to the atmosphere. The pop songs playing in the background may seem out of place but it looks like they’re trying to target the younger crowd vs the banker type as this night shows.
There is only one chef with his assistants in the background. The chef introduced himself before the meal to everyone and is quite friendly, probably the most friendly chef I ever met. As he chats with everyone, it’s easy to overlook he is serving so many ppl all by himself when at most Omakases, 3 to 4 is the max for a chef. Talking and preparing is second nature to him and he never missed a beat in his preparation.
All the niceties are here. Warm towel, finger wipe, napkin, and prompt service.
I found the cooked dishes were quite good and better than the sushi portion of the meal. The sushi was of good quality but small and somewhat generic. There were no star dish during this meal and it was all quite forgettable to me.
I also decided on some very expensive liquor but they do not even pour in front of me. When it’s more than a 100 a sip, they should pour in front of me. A very big miss here.
In all, it’s not a $300+ meal unless you enjoy being pampered but I look for a balance of ambiance, food, and service and they only succeed in the ambiance. There are many exceptional Omakases in the city that cost only $200 including tip and tax and some even less and they all have a star dish but here, all you get is an expensive bill with nothing much to cheer about.",null,5,0,1,0,1,7 reviews,Noda

 Who cares about the sushi, their ambiance, their decor when they charge double? I used Tock before and it was success.

The meal was at least as good as any omakase I've had around the world, including at chef's former home at Sushi Iwa. Selection varies daily, but the Hokkaido uni chawanmushi with caviar was a delight to start, and the botan ebi is a personal favorite that is too infrequently seen. Every course was delicious.

The pre-dinner signature cocktails were unique and creative, and the Japanese whisky selection is extensive with knowledgeable staff to match (although perhaps not the easiest on the budget). Similarly, the sake list is wide-ranging. My only regret is not having gone with a bottle -- while the sake pairing provides a good tour of styles that match the meal, it did not seem like a good value compared to the bottle offerings.

Definitely one of the top sushi options in NYC.",null,5,0,1,0,1,7 reviews,Noda

If Ambiance, Service, Food and Price are the four key evaluation categories, Benno scores high on most.
The menu is limited and non-mainstream, and the food is exquisite. In every way top-notch, and up to the most rarified competitors in New York. The portions are small, but the food is well imagined, high-quality, exquisitely produced and plated, and delicious.
The service is practiced, trained, formal but friendly, intelligent and delivered by a team. If only they had more to do. 
Prices are high – very high, but in a different environment you would expect it. 
Ambiance is the problem, and one wishes given the earnestness and skill of the staff that there was a way to overcome it.
Nothing wrong with the address. So many old buildings are being converted or reconverted into hotels, this being one. Jonathan Benno evidently oversees the street-front bakery, the more casual restaurant plus the formal restaurant.
The formal restaurant is in the back, a large, double height room with a skylight atrium. It may have been created from what was a backyard and converted into an inside room. It is not warm.
On a Tuesday night the room was considerably less than half full. The combination of décor, volume, location and graceless access through the other parts of the hotel to the back combine to create an energy/ambiance void, which never went away, notwithstanding the high level of service and exceptional level of the food.

The meal started with an amuse bousche, which was tasty, followed by a couple Parker House rolls with onion-laced butter, which were quite good. My first course was the risotto with black truffle. The amount of truffle shaved on the risotto was quite generous.
I got the duck entree. The foie gras was delicious although I would have liked the interior to be a bit warmer. The duck sausage was very good. The duck was good but a bit tough. The beans and root vegetables were very tasty.
Both of these courses were a bit small and I was still hungry. I decided to get their cheese course. They only have one choice for cheese. It was OK but it wasn't one I was thrilled by. I would have liked more choices. It was also a fairly hard cheese, which couldn't be spread on the crackers. Like the appetizer and entree, the cheese course was rather small. I ate the crackers with the small amount of jam provided. It wasn't nearly enough for all three crackers so I ate what remained by themselves. They were rather hard and difficult to chew.
My server, the bartender, was very knowledgeable about the food and quite attentive. The atmosphere at the bar was OK. I'd prefer a little higher light levels but I could read the menu.

Sushi Inoue, however, is not to be included in this category.
$275 pp omakase advertised as 7 appetizers plus soup, sushi and dessert. Only half of the listed appetizers on the menu were offered- the rest were substituted with cheap choices. On top of that, they only served six appetizers, rather than the listed seven. The substitutes consisted of a canned tomato soup with overboiled noodles, a sweet corn soup with a piece of frozen shrimp(still frozen and obviously tasteless) and a fried sea eel tempura which was also tasteless.
Unit tasting was the best of the lot, but still mediocre at best, compared to other high end sushi restaurants.
Coming to the sushi, the only above average piece was the mid fatty tuna. One piece was octopus, which is never offered in high end omakase restaurants. The rest of the nigiri was completely forgettable. Fatty tuna hand roll consisted of two blocks of mid fatty tuna and one block of regular tuna-why mix the two?
Dessert was a complete embarrassment- half a soggy wafer wrapped around green tea ice cream, which was likely purchased as one piece at a Japanese deli for $1.
Finally, the restaurant adds an automatic 20% tip!

However, they were qiute classic and conservative with the flavours and textures.

We didn't like the flavours in the souffle we asked for desert, For our taste it was too sweet and spicy and did not enjoy the icecream that came with it either. 
At the end, it felt pricey for what we have eaten (300USD bill wiht one glass of wine each) for a three course menu that didn't impress.

We went for 5:30 so we could go for a walk afterwards. 
We were running a bit late and they had a grace period of 15 mins which we just made. We were seated at a large booth which was very spacious. Our server came by shortly to welcome us to Cote asked if it was our first time there (and it was). We weren't super hungry so we wanted to make sure we didn't get large portions. Even after stating this, the server still recommended we get some appetizers which we did. We ended up get the shrimp app with the Butcher's Feast as our main. Along with that, there were many side dishes, rice, soup etc that came with the meal. The appetizer wasn't needed. The cooking itself was done by the server and she would go around from table to table and cook for all the customers. She was friendly enough but didn't seem like she really wanted to be there (just my opinion). She would explain the cut of the meat and cook in front of us. We were given a bunch of sides before the cooking started and about 1/2 way through the Butcher Feast, a bunch more sides came out. Everything was good and authentic, however we were pretty stuffed at this point and wasn't really enjoying the meal as much as we would like. 
Definitely come hungry and perhaps skip ordering any additional apps since the sides they provide are plentiful! We were given complimentary ice cream which was very yummy but they did not provide any additional complimentary dessert for my husband's birthday (which was fine since we were stuffed).",Certificate of Excellence2019 Winner,75,35,12,9,6,170 reviews,Cote

It took about 1.5hrs to finish my dinner which was the shortest I’ve ever dined at any fine dining restaurant, much less at a 3 Michelin starred restaurant. I was very disappointed ... I wanted to savor every bite with ease. My palate hasn’t fully enjoyed the last dish when another followed in minutes. I also had to keep asking for hot water and sliced of lemons. My waiter did NOT do a good job of checking back to see if I needed anything. Very unprofessional I must say! I’m a Michelin Star enthusiasts and been to several 3 Michelin stars all over the world completing the eight 3 Michelin stars in the Bay Area (see my profile and reviews). The highlight of my visit here was seeing the kitchen where the magic all occurred. I can’t think of any dish that made an impression. Even the caviar with cheesecake wasn’t impressive. I mainly ate the caviar; the cheesecake was unnecessary. Had dinner at Aquavit two nights before and their caviar was so good with a beautiful food presentation (see my pix/review).",Certificate of Excellence2016 - 2019 Winner,"1,550",272,192,77,60,"2,596 reviews",Eleven Madison Park

My only complaint, and it sounds like a quibbling one, is that the meal, while varied, tasty, and luxurious is also minimalistic. In terms of value ($295) and expectations for world-class cuisine, in terms of the top 50 restaurants on Earth, I find Eleven Madison Park somewhat lacking in pizzazz and thrills. My meal had some tender lobster, a bit of black caviar, a few oysters, some trout, and a nice petite sliver of duck, but après tout, I asked, is that it? The dessert underwhelmed, and as in the past, there was no chocolate petit fours but only some excuses muttered unconvincingly. The more modest wine-pairing at $175 per person additional had some nice vineyards and complimented well but lacked depth.

The ambiance was incredible, such a delightful space, but really and truly what made EMP unforgettable were the service/people and the food. EMP's staff were both genuinely welcoming and attentive. They made us feel like part of the family while still providing the best service. Madison was amazing throughout the night, and ushered us from entree to entree seamlessly. Little details throughout the night showed her attention to detail; for example during conversation about her hometown we disclosed that our dog was from the same city, and at the end, she had a take home bin of treats for our pup. That was so thoughtful and really speaks to the remarkable service. Brady (the sommelier) was equally as incredible. He helped my husband pick the right bottle of wine for his palate and also made great recommendations for cocktails for me. He was kind enough to show us the cellar, which is incredible. Lisa took us to be back of the kitchen where one of the pastry chefs prepared a quick little dessert bite for us during the kitchen tour. It was a true pleasure seeing the ""well oiled machine"" that is the Staff at EMP working so seamlessly together while somehow managing to make us feel extra special. 
In regards to the food, every plate was perfectly balanced. The portions were generous, compared to other restaurants. The platings were elegant and not over done, the taste of the food was amazing. From start to finish it was a treat. Brandy and pretzels at the end of the night was a delightful surprise. It is obvious that a lot of thought has gone into the dining experience.

I liked much the pragmatic sommelier : he realized I had got scared with the New Yorker prices of my favorite Bordeaux´s ( way more expensive than the price in Paris). Then, he suggested a Napa´s ""honest"" alternative to replace it. It worked !

I was one of the lucky visitors just before Christmas, however, I did not have to help myself to the delicacies, since one sample after another was brought to my table. 
First gravlax (marinated salmon) and three different herrings were served. The gravlax melted in my mouth and the the three different herrings were delicious. Naturally I drank a danish beer and started lightly downing an aquavit with Islandic design. 
After tossing a few cubes of cheese from the north of Sweden into my mouth, I realized this was just the beginning. 
More food consisting of homemade prince sausages, Swedish meatballs and barbecued ribs landed on the table. 
More beer and aquavit arrived as well. 
I stuffed myself and loved every second. 
Before I reached the finish line I enjoyed a “kladdkaka” and a miniature princess cake for dessert.

As the chef is Swedish, it missed some of the Danish curses, but overall I enjoyed it and the quality was excellent. The reason for 4 stars is that my wife was less impressed and really needed a few salad options (although they are not really part of the original xmas lunch).

They also lie about wait times. I got there before the rest of my party at around 6, and there was no wait but they can't seat you until your whole party is there. Then, my friend got there at 6:30 to put her name down, and they quoted her a half hour wait. Not knowing that we already put our names down, our other friend got there at 6:40 and they quoted her an hour and a half wait. They're supposed to text when the table it ready, so we go to a bar nearby. It's 7:15 and we still haven't received a text, so we decide to go to the restaurant to check it out. They tell us that it's still going to be another half hour. We didn't end up getting seated until 8. So my suggestion would be to go right before 6, and that's the quickest way to get a table. 
Seating situation aside, the food is pretty great. It's authentic Thai food, so you won't find Pad Thais or Pad See Ews here. There were so many things we wanted to try but we narrowed it down to a few to share:
Plaa Hoi Shenn (raw chilled sea scallops with basil seeds, lemongrass, basil blossom, and passionfruit nam prik) - the actual scallops were good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the passionfruit nam prik
Hoi Tak (green curry snails with crispy garlic & herbs) - these were SO good. Our waitress suggested we order a side of naan to soak up the sauce and it was the best idea
Kao Pat Puu (crab fried rice with egg, cilantro, and lime) - this was my favorite dish of the night. I loved the huge chunks of crab, and the green chili sauce it was served with
Khao Soi (golden curry with egg noodles, chicken leg, pickled mustard greens, and fresh turmeric) - a pretty solid Khao Soi. I really liked the broth. It was a bit too much pickled mustard greens though
Massaman Neuh (boneless beef ribs with massaman curry, potato, red onion, peanut, and green peppercorn) - not my favorite. Not sure if it was because of the texture of the beef or the peanuts (or maybe both) but I probably would not order this one again
For drinks, I tried the Bolan cocktail (jasmine bourbon, lemongrass, angostura bitters). I didn't really taste the jasmine or the lemongrass. The bitters was over-powering, so it just tasted like an Old Fashioned.
I don't know if I'd want to wait another 1.5 hours but I definitely want to try some of their other dishes. Next time, I'll just make sure to come right before the dinner rush.",Certificate of Excellence2016 - 2019 Winner,137,64,19,9,11,278 reviews,Uncle Boons

The one thing that rated high for me was the atmosphere. There is no doubt this place is bustling with people willing to wait over an hour for a table, however after having grown up in Australia and New Zealand, fresh produce is something of a rarity in New York.
The baby octopus was overcooked and powdery, and the charred bits consumed any other flavour. The rice that accompanied the duck was so drenched in duck liver it made the main duck too rich to eat. The ribs were fried and covered in salt when they really should have been slow cooked to let the really flavour melt in your mouth. Overall, things like charcoal, sugar, fat took over where the flavours of the core ingredients should have shone through. Freshness is key in Asian food and the dishes felt like anything but fresh...it was all overdone.

The tone is casual elegant so no sneaks expected but no jackets required, a nice comfortable balance. 
There is a nice selection of offerings to cover all food preferences and they are also accommodating to special dietary requests. My friend and I came in planning to do a sampling from the menu and our waiter, Travis, brought to our attention that a dinner option was a four course prix fixe that would provide us with all our planned choices and dessert as well, a great option if you are going for the full menu options. We started with oysters and leeks with hazelnuts. The oysters were clean and fresh tasting with a nice hint of the sea, the leeks lightly cooked in a very mild sauce with hazelnuts was a pleasant bite. We then moved on to the foie gras in a light but delicious jus, and the toasted bread that came with the dish was well appreciated to sop up every drop of the sauce. The foie gras was melt in your mouth wonderful. We also had the faux snails which were actually a layering of a mussel, turnip, and topped with sea urchin served in a snail dish. Again a little bread will serve you well to mop up the remaining sauce in the snail cuppings . For the main courses we tried the halibut over dakon , the fish was tender and the white sauce enhanced but didnt over power the taste, the mildly tart dakon was a nice counterpoint to the sweet fish. The prime filet was tender and it's accompanying side of oxtail under thinly sliced potatoes was a richly tasting meat lovers treat. I'd like to mention that portions are fairly generous and one could easily order less than we did and still have a very satisfying experience. Desserts were elegantly made and almost too beautiful to eat...almost but we enjoyed our Tarte Tatin, Chocolat Coucou, and a version of a classic Baked Alaskan. 
Wine and beer options are good and cover all price points and staff is knowledgeable to offer recommendations to fit your tastes and budget.
While this is not an inexpensive restaurant, it is a good value restaurant when you consider the quality of the food, the excellent service, comfortable surroundings and that you will be enjoying your meal for a couple of hours at a nice leisurely pace.

I was getting old New York glam vibe with the red velvet fabric from the curtains and seats in the main dining area which was where our reserved table was. There’s seating in the courtyard as well which I thought had a whimsical and casual feel to it. 
Gin-based cocktail to start please! With sweet and tarty notes to wake up my tastebuds, Nod to Nothing prepared me for my meal. For food, first came the Brussels Sprouts fried with cayenne and brown sugar served alongside buttermilk for dipping. I’ve never seen this preparation before and I’m not exaggerating, this has been the best I’ve had yet. A little thrown off, I expected the Chicken Sandwich to be fried. On the menu it says “Chicken Sandwich - brioche, black truffles and foie gras”. Sounds like a winner, yes? Maybe if it was fried. The Carbonara was the one dish I was looking forward to but a shame how underwhelming it was.

If ever you want to have a fine dining experience, but you don’t want to pay the high price of fine dining, do some research and see if your restaurant of choice offers a breakfast service. This way you can have the experience, and not only pay a lower price, but you also have the advantage of dressing very casual (leggings and sneakers). Upon entering the nomad hotel, the dark tapestries give you a sense of mystery, and I immediately think “Prohibition Elegance”. It’s rather dark when you enter the hotel, but it opens to the dining room which is beautifully lit by the natural light of the open ceiling. My server Raul was very attentive, when he walked me to my table, he immediately took my coat and checked it for me. My menu was already placed on my table, so my glass was filled with water and coffee immediately followed. I am a coffee snob, and the coffee here is exceptional. I ordered the omelet with hen of the woods mushrooms which came with multigrain toast and salad greens. The meal was tasty, but the omelet a bit salty. It’s presented with coarse sea salt on top of the omelet, but in my experience coarse sea salt is very salty, and I believe it should only be served on the side. Raul, and another young lady (whose name I did not get) were very attentive to my needs, and when I was ready to leave, I had a rare experience where Raul held my coat up and put it on for me.  It is indeed the little things that I pay close attention to. I enjoyed the meal, but the service took it over the top. I give the meal an 8 and the service a 10… Awesome!",Certificate of Excellence2016 - 2019 Winner,476,202,71,37,16,"1,018 reviews",NoMad

The fish is as fresh and as good as they come, but my criticism comes from the lack of creativity and differentiation for a one star restaurant. I can very much claim to have tried some of the best sushi restaurants around the world, and Michelin starred sushi restaurants always have one thing in common: giving you some pieces that can only be experienced at that restaurant. This is either via the sourcing of fish (arising from superb knowledge of seasons and where, globally, to acquire the fish from which source and via connections), the way the piece is put together (flavoring), or both.
As you can see from my photos, there is pretty much zero surprise from beginning to end. Every piece of fish/dish I can recognize and taste I can recall. The preparation is exactly how it is - plain vanilla with soy sauce.
If you are looking for a first class, run of the mill experience but with the best fish of its class, then you should come here. My view is that the chef is simply not experienced enough (he’s too young). He couldn’t have had learnt either the deep culinary skills or having the network/relationships for fish sourcing to provide a world class experience. 
And the fact that the restaurant has 2 seatings, 6 and 8:30, really bothers me. It means that commercial opportunity is prioritized over experience. The preparation of fish is “altogether” when each piece is served, and without a team (solo chef) it is clearly very taxing on the chef. The focus was therefore execution rather than thought and careful preparation.

The price is reasonable at $250 for omakase, but then again comparatively the price-to-value isn’t that great. My suggestion is for the restaurant to go back to the basics first. Really earn that star rather than trying to maximize the commercial opportunity at the same time.",null,4,1,1,0,0,9 reviews,Sushi Amane

Billed as a “contemporary American restaurant with Asian influences” it meets that label pretty damn well.
In a stylishly decorated, large space, with exposed brick walls interspersed with decorative panels, plaster & ceramic wall tile, mirrors, empty frames masquerading as artwork, potted flowers, bare wood floors and tables, funky lighting, etc… this space is at the same time exciting and functionally done. The noise level is a bit high, though, because of this.
The menu is also a bit sparse… and while the prices are above average, the portions are ridiculously small ~ way below average. 
We had 2 glasses of rose wine ($28) and a plate of chicken liver ($14) to start, and then asked for the wagyu beef ($38) and snow crab pasta ($33) as our mains. Initially, we were planning to order another salad and share the snow crab, and asked the waiter if this was a large enough serving for us to share, and he assured us it was ~ stating that it had “a full crab shredded over the pasta.” Sounded great, but well, look at my photos. We could barely see the crab, and definitely didn’t see the squash.. it must have been juiced ! The beef I ordered instead of sharing the pasta was also a pathetically tiny serving (photos …again !!) It was gone even before I could decide if it was good.. another reason to stay away from these “small plates” rip-off wonders.

We live in the neighborhood and had often thought of visiting this restaurant but were often confused by the Michelin star which was overshadowed by the opinions of other self critics here on trip advisor which said it was way overpriced and overrated.
Tonight, despite the reviews, we decided to check it out for ourselves. I must repeat emphatically that is was nothing less than exceptional! We started the evening with a beautiful little potato and ricotta dish that was sent out as a gift from the chef. It was light and lovely but that was only the beginning. We ordered some very nice cocktails. I ordered he dragon sangria and it was a nice way to start off the evening. We ordered the octopus, the deviled eggs and the chicken liver mousse and although all of them were superb we thought the foam brown butter sauce on the octopus deserved special mention. It was so rich and had a such a great mouth feel , but it also had a wonderful taste, which is often absent in a foam sauce. As for the entrees, we shared the pig out which was a crispy pork belly with 3 different sauces on the plate, and a side portion of peanut noodles and although the pork was delicious the real standout was the garnish of arugula salad with lycees and candied walnuts. We also tried the halibut with a gorgeous light curry cream sauce that was superb as well. Everyone at the table loved the crab noodles which were very light in taste but very delicious, but the winner for me was the side dish of rice. It was sweet and pudding like and went so well with the curry and the pork! Last, but not least we had the roasted carrots with a smoky sauce and they showed just how versatile and skilled the chef was to do so much with simple ingredients like carrots. We were so stuffed we literally couldn’t eat all of our food. It was all so rich and had so many different sauces and flavors. We were completely overwhelmed by this unassuming little restaurant that leaves behind the pretentiousness but delivers on the flavor. We couldn’t leave without trying their dessert and we all shared an order of beignets with vanilla ice cream and red bean paste with a squeeze bottle of caramel sauce on the side. It was the best ice cream sandwich ever. We walked home amazed by this completely unexpected and delightful experience. The service was outstanding, the food was delicious and rich and satisfying and i wondered to myself how it could be that anyone could complain about it. My only advice is, if you are reading this review, if you really like a massive steak hanging off your plate with no sauce, you are definitely in the wrong place; however, if you enjoy watching the imagination of a perfectionist chef run wild, this might be the place for you. After dinner we debated would we go to Marea or Le CouCou or Aqyavit overTuome and we all decided we wouldn’t miss this for the world!!!

The star of the show here is the “Pig Out” (for two), which consists of little squares of crispy pork belly with sides of peanut noodles. 
The Pork belly squares are delicious but I honestly didn’t care for the peanut noodle, it was overly sweet for my taste almost like straight out peanut butter. Don’t miss the snow crab, it was really yummy!
We ordered almost the whole menu LOL!! Definitely a #pigout night
Appetizer – 
SHRIMP TOAST - wasabi aioli, watercress, chives
CHICKEN LIVER - mousse, maple, milk bread. I’ve been thinking and telling friends about this dish since we tried it. Chicken liver mousse on a toast with the sweet maple syrup, sea salt, and pumpkin seeds, it’s just awesome. A must!

Main – 

PIG OUT (FOR TWO) - berkshire pork, spicy peanut noodle, condiments. For $49, you get 10 blocks of crispy pork belly, and two bowls of al dente peanut noodles. That’s a lot. A pretty rich choice for date night, but come with a few friends and get one for the table.

I understand you may have dined with us on a slower night when the majority of our guests were seated near the bar. I see how that can make the front of the restaurant feel empty. 
As far as the offering, our short story tasting menu is described ""about six courses,"" which is six composed dishes plus bread service and petit fours. Thank you for the feedback regarding the beef; we have passed this on to Chef. 
While we certainly do not think of International wines are ordinary, we want to make sure all guests are happy with this offering. We stand by our 3 oz pours as this is quite customary industry wide but I will look at the producers featured on the evening of your dinner and see where there may be room for improvement. 
I want to extend our sincere apologies if you had to request menus or have the check dropped before you were ready. 
We appreciate your comprehensive feedback and will use it to improve.

When we arrived, we found all the customers (about twelve) huddled in the rear of the restaurant, which is not a welcoming sight. We were shown to our table, then ignored for more than five minutes whilst the waiters (all male) talked among themselves and/or played with their ipads behind a low separating wall. I eventually had to demand menus.
The meal itself (a seven dish tasting menu called Short Story) was disappointing. The chef is obviously talented, judging by six of the teeny dishes, but the big item, New Zealand beef, was chewy and tasteless. 
What really turned me off, however, was the International Wine Pairing, priced at $60, and consisting of 5 very ordinary wines (some without even a domain name) with an average retail price, by my calculation, of $25, which makes the restaurant's cost per 3 oz. glass at about $1.

My first experience of dining at a US Michelin star rated restaurant has left me confused and maybe a little disappointed...
We opted for the ""Short Story"" Tasting Menu (six courses), with accompanying international wine pairings. In addition, we added an additional course of the ""Hangi Potato"" at the recommendation of our waiter. There can be absolutely no doubt that each dish was prepared by very talented chefs. Each dish was well conceived and presented in a manner befitting of a Michelin Star. A brief explanation as to the thought process behind each dish was given when presented, but nothing overly elaborate that would really link the dish back to the heritage of New Zealand. The matching wines were very well paired and were selected from all over the world which provided lovely variety throughout the meal.
However, a few things just weren't up to the standard I have come to expect from a Michelin Star restaurant:
1) We were seated in what can really only be described as a bar. I understand that the restaurant has a dining room towards the rear of the restaurant which I imagine would lend itself to a more refined dining experience, however, being situated in front of a busy and at times, oppresively noisy bar detracted hugely from the ambience of other restaurants which I have dined in of a similar standard;
2) Our table was situated on an uneven surface and was a general annoyance throughout the meal;
3) Service was very relaxed. When paying circa £350 for a meal, I expect to receive an elevated level of service. This just wasnt apparent. There was nothing bad per se, it just wasnt made to feel that this was a special meal;
4) I found it odd that the wine pairing was often served well in advance of the corresponding course. In my opinion, a pairing should be just that...served to compliment one another;
5) Some of the timings between courses were elongated. I appreciate that it was a Saturday night however and that there were some larger tables seated but service just felt a bit disjointed. Towards the end, we almost felt a bit rushed; the petit fours and bill following completion of our dessert course rapidly. It would have been nice not to have felt compelled to settle up quite so quickly;
6) Service charge... I get that this is a cultural thing, but the notion that a restaurant ought to be able to tell a patron what they suggest a tip should be is both rude and assuming. This really ought to be at the discretion of the diner - based upon the actual level of service received;
7) Unfortunately, despite the high quality of dishes on offer, I'm not entirely sure that I will remember any of them with any sort of distinction in a month or so's time. Generally there will be at least one dish from a tasting menu that will wow me... this was lacking in this instance.
So... whilst the food on offer at the Musket Room is undoubtedly of a high standard, their Michelin Star rating has left me a little confused as to whether the criteria deployed is the same in the US to that which is used to assign Michelin Stars to restaurants in the UK and Europe. Maybe we caught the Musket Room on one of their poorer evenings? 
Would I return? No. Would I recommend to others? I think I'd struggle to justify the cost vs the experience.",Certificate of Excellence2016 - 2019 Winner,204,49,21,7,1,309 reviews,The Musket Room

Pricing of the wine was beyond extreme - a bottle of Cloudy Bay Sauv Blanc 2018 Marlborough NZ for USD$134.00! What an absolute joke (conversion from AUD to USD $23.00 to buy in a bottle shop in OZ). Staff presentation was lacking, very casual. For the price that we payed (for 2 adults) inclusive of drinks was just over USD $420.00.

The first few were served within minutes of each other and then the last few took much, much longer. We weren’t once asked if we wanted another drink, our glasses sat empty for 20 minutes until we could get someone’s attention to order another. We also weren’t asked how we were enjoying the food which as several courses we didn’t finish, I feel it was quite obvious we were not happy. The venison dish in particular was under seasoned, tasteless and luke warm. I just feel when you are charging $165 a head you simply cannot provide such poor service. We left feeling deflated and not being given the opportunity to rectify the issues also added to our disappointment.

Food enjoyable - my favourite dish being the pavlova with passion fruit. 
Slightly alarming was the scallop dish arriving when I was still eating my sourdough from the earlier dish. The waiter just moved my plate to one side & put the scallops down (I felt kitchen timings had probably been off in this case due to the menu supposedly being a “story”).
Having eaten at several 1 Michelin star restaurants in the UK I know what to expect & sadly the vibe was not for me. 
Felt more like a fast food restaurant - waiters rushing about, didn’t support a relaxed dining experience. Music was loud, restaurant very noisy so struggled to have conversations. 
LOTS of tables crammed in - again, my experience of 1 Michelin star restaurants is that you have a unique dining experience, sadly this wasn’t it. Whilst I am all for a relaxed dress code, there were people sat with hoodies & hats on eating. 
I have no problem with this when I am in my local chain restaurant but not when I’m paying over $100 per person for a meal.

Tempura lovers will appreciate the exquisite texture of the fried paste, an extremely thin, tasty and light coating, covering ultra fresh ingredients, BUT, all this comes at an abnormally high price. 
There are 3 fixed price menus and I would advise going for the cheapest. The price difference, important, is not justified by what you get extra, noticeably a sashimi appetizer, fresh but not exceptional, that will cost you a preposterous amount of money.
Sitting at the bar (recommended) you can watch the two cooks at work, as they skilfully craft the tempuras right under your eyes.
Yet, the atmosphere is icy, as too often in high-end Japanese places. Obviously, the chefs are not there for exchanging smiles and the lady “Maitre d’Hotel” watching over each of your movements is more intimidating than entertaining.
Good Japanese restaurants in NY are now more expensive than their counterparts in Tokyo and the “de luxe” omakase, popularized by the master Jiro Ono, has inspired his New-Yorker alter-egos who run the same formula, only for a much higher price, although none of them can compare with the Ginza magnificent chef..
Tempura Matsui is a good example of this unfortunate trend. U I had even better tempura in Japan, particularly in Nara old town (meaning being transported in a Kurosawa movie) for a much lower price...

Running through the food..grain of salt on what to order because I don't love cheese and I handled ordering:
Oysters - really good, came with like a fresh red pepper/mix/light vinegar ready to go, some of the best oysters I've had.
Marinated Mussels - these were fantastic with an onion mix on top. Great mix of flavors + presentation.
Mauntauk Sea Scallops - raw with daikon on top, really good, we almost ordered a second.
Tuna - interesting tuna presentation as one long raw piece, in a great peppery/oil sauce (interesting as in good).
Skate Wing - fried, which I should have anticipated, done perfectly and the pineapple slaw on top was delicious.
Gnocchi- Not a cheese or gnocchi person, but these were perfectly delicate and the chives added a nice crunch to the sauce
Chicken - The sweet potato mash was great, presentation is cool, skin of the chicken was fantastic...was a top tier, very moist chicken...perfectly well done, but compared to everything else wasn't a highlight.
Ribeye - was delicious, most expensive thing on menu but perfect for sharing, good sauce on it, and a really good flavor from the dry-aging.

The dishes were well composed and good, however missing that little extra in the seasoning. I also found it quite disturbing when our waiter went overboard in trying to sell us the Caviar extras, as I expect this to be handled in a much more subtle way at a restaurant of Michelin class.

There are two rooms with different menus for lunch: front room by the bar for drop-ins (a la carte), and back room with reservations (a la carte or prix fix tasting menus). Decor is surprising for NYC: CA rancho style with high vaulted ceilings, very peaceful and relatively quiet. Tables are widely spaced, and service outstanding, making an unusually pleasant dining experience. 
Good range of entrees and appetizers, all very tasty and beautifully plated. You can make special requests for dish alterations. Good, but pricey wine list. Lovely, crisp salads and very good fresh-baked rolls. We had 4 popular entrees, and rated them: superb burger, excellent schnitzel, very good char and tile fish. Dessert menu looks fabulous, but we had no room. 
Expensive, but very well worth it for special occasions. Tips and coatcheck included in prices. Lunch about $50 each without alcohol. Highly recommended.",Travellers' Choice2019 Winner,"2,401",565,215,70,29,"3,688 reviews",Gramercy Tavern

Overall, although the food was of good quality, the noise level in the restaurant was such that a normal conversation was hardly possible. I really liked the pasta with oxtail, 3 cheeses and truffle. My wife's main course was good but not really all that special; and the service was slow, as if we were an after-thought. On the positive side, the waiter gave us (in brought strokes) the recipe for my dish. We have tried it at home and it worked out great.
Bottom-line: I am sure they are on to something in that place; but we have decided not to go back there, as a normal conversation was not possible with the noise level; and as a result, we were eating as fast as possible to be able to get out and have a normal conversation somewhere else.

2. An amateur host asked the four of us
to follow him to our table, only to tell us in the middle of dining room that he had made a mistake and the table was not ready. Go back and wait. 
3. To their credit, they did offer free drinks while we were waiting. 
4. The FIRST food item to arrive (amuse bouche) arrived at the table at 950 pm for an 830 reservation.
5. The manager apologized but the poor service continued. Had to ask for bread 3 times before it arrived 15 min after the amuse bouche. Then they kept serving bread nonstop which became annoying given 30+ min intervals between the servings of tiny portions for this multi-course meal. 
6. At ~$200 per person without drinks, they mismatched the food -person three times!
7. The food was OK to good. None of the food items were amazing. Desserts were exceptional.
8. We had been to the old Bouley several times and thought it was much better than its rivals at the time ( Jean Georges, Daniel, etc.). This experience reversed all that. Sadly, this was emblematic of a talented chef lured by greed and the prospects of wealthy tourists blindly splurging on mediocrity.

The well meaning coat checker was busy with something else so we stood in limbo between the front door and Chef Boulez who had been accosted by a gaggle of tittering Chinese ladies. We barely got a glance from him as we finally squeezed through. Then, no official greeting (it seems there is no Maitre d’ Hotel) from anyone. We stood awkwardly waiting for ten minutes for a table despite several suited gentleman officially prowling the room. 
Things got better. The prix fixe was a good deal for a six course dinner. That it ran from 9-12 was not surprising but slightly irritating, A as I was guaranteed when I made my reservation that we would leave in time to catch a midnight mass. 
We were treated well and in a professional manner. The food, our reason for being there, was excellent in every way. The portions are perfect, the attention to detail, phenomenal, the tastes, surprising and good.

From the minute you walk in you can tell this is a classy place. The decor and lighting and the professionalism of the staff make you feel a little like royalty. We went with the five course Il Menu Del Posto with the wine pairing. We were waited on by several people, all extremely courteous, knowledgeable and friendly. Our sommelier was particularly memorable. He clearly knows his business very well and seems to really enjoy his work. The dishes that came out were each more delicious than the last and the presentation was excellent. To give you an idea of just how much we enjoyed the food: the bread and butter (whipped in house) were actually amazing. I've never had butter both so tasty and so light. They topped off the evening with a lovely dessert with a candle and with happy birthday written on it. Very nice touch indeed.

We had the $69 prix-fixe lunch, which was a great deal, actually (but see the caution below.).

For appetizers, we had: Arctic Char trio - crudo with Osetra caviar, light confit with parsley root puree, and tartare with great celery root chips;.and vitello tonnato with fried shallots and colatura sauce. My secondi was short ribs ($20 extra) with spinach, roasted mushrooms, a polenta foam, and red wine veal jus. Hers was chicken with a mild truffle jus - the thigh meat was breaded and fried, and the breast meat had an artichoke stuffing. For dessert, I had a vanilla and forbidden rice panna cotta with pear and black sesame sorbet, while she had a semi-firm ricotta with olive oil crackers. They also brought us several fancy chocolates at the end. The food was beautifully prepared and delicious. 
A caution on the price: It's easy to boost it by a lot. I chose the one entree with a surcharge, and bottled still or sparkling water can run you $10 apiece, and their wine list can get pricey as well.

Long story short, the only good thing about the meal was the excellent rice. The fish was average quality and not worth the 300 price tag. The flavor profiles were non existent. In fact, with drinks and taxes it came out to 450 a person. Definitely not worth the money and I left hungry which is very unusual. I can safely say that I would never go back to this place.

That really got my attention because Masa is damn good even though it is damn expensive.
I came here on a weekday and noticed it was pretty empty with only five ppl so more than half the table is empty. It was weird because Open Table only had one open time. This is not a good sign as other competitors are packed on a similar weekday.
The ambiance is what you would expect at a traditional Omakase. Very bright and very minimalistic. I know this is typical Omakase but it’s boring and I don’t like it.
Overall, the food is high quality. The toro is amazing but not better than Shuko or even Nakazawa. I definitely had better toro elsewhere. The eel sushi is no good and over cooked and tasted like slush. Best eel is at 15 East. The real stars here are the miso soup and green tea. These are the best I ever had.
After about $500, I was still hungry but luckily a KFC is nearby and still open. At this price point, it’s cheaper than Masa but I was quite full after eating at Masa. This price does not even include drink pairing while you can get Omakase and drink pairing for the same price at Shuko - quite a bargain. For better bang for the buck, skip the drink pairing at Shuko or even opt for sushi only since they are by far the stars of the entire meal.
Ultimately, amazing sushi but bad value. It could be because the fish is flown in from Japan. Not really worth paying for since the fish here is good enough.",null,19,2,2,2,2,35 reviews,Sushi Ginza Onodera

The actual omekase was wonderfully paced - we didn't feel rushed or hurried, the chef was wonderfully conversational and paid attention to little details (left-handed people were served with the fish facing the right way, women first, good descriptions of what was being served, etc.) The quality of fish was very good - everything was an adventure, texture-wise, and the flavors really popped on some items: Black Seaperch with horseradish, Sardine, Akami (lean tuna), Cherry Blossom Trout stood out.

The experience was one of the best in a Japanese restaurant in NYC we've had, which is a high bar given the number of excellent venues in the city. 
The venue was hidden, sleek, and modern. We opted for the 7-course pre-fixe, and ended up getting an amusee as well as extra Soba noodles at no cost. It was plenty of food but there is a 9-courses option if you are extra hungry. The dishes were very well-paced and generally progressed from more ""raw"" (sashimi, wrapped scallops"" to more ""cooked"" (shrimp head tempura, final dish was a wagyu steak) which was one of the many times we noticed Hirohisa's meticulous attention to detail. The dishes were all extremely delicious and high-quality, with the standouts being the shrimp head sashimi (part of the arctic shrimp in the sashimi tasting), eel rice, wagyu steak, and all the desserts in the final platter. 
The best part of the night, perhaps, was talking to Chef Hirohisa after things quieted down a bit late at night. We chatted and asked him about his favorite restaurants back home in Japan (as we are visiting in a few months) - he ended up emailing us later that night with a long list of his favorites, including tough-to-find-for-foreigners local joints as well as restaurants ran by his cousin (in the Four Seasons Tokyo, so definitely not too shabby!) We were very impressed and thankful that he took time out of his own schedule to help us plan our trip, which we think really speak to the Chef's character beyond being a genius in the kitchen.

The fresh fish may not be a surprising thing at NY's authentic Japanese sushi restaurant.
But I must say this- their egg is beyond amazing. Truly, it is quite difficult to find this level of egg slice even in Japan. Just two thumbs up and that certainly tells the high standard of sushi restaurant.

This is a restaurant inside a restaurant and you don't go there because it is cheap, rather for the experience.
Second, Omakase is a Japanese phrase that means ""I'll leave it up to you"". The Chef selects the menu and I believe they fly their sushi in from Japan each day. The quality of their fish is unlike anything I've experienced in my life.
Finally, the amount of time and careful consideration that the Chef takes in preparing each individual piece of sushi is like watching art being made in front of you. His meticulous nature truly made me feel like I was in Japan. The staff is constantly ensuring that you are being given the highest quality of service and I appreciated that.
The restaurant is very expensive, but it is truly a remarkable experience. The bartender makes his uniquely designed specialty drinks and thought simply goes into every detail of this restaurant. Not many places in the US have Michelin rated restaurants so if you have an opportunity to come to this one, and you understand that quality is not cheap, you will not be dissapointed.

I never really tried Sushi Zen even though I pass by it many times but this restaurant did live up to the words of people who been to Sushi Zen and love it.
The entrance is very unassuming and you might even miss it if you're not too careful. You have to take the elevator or stairs down because it's underground on the basement level. The walls are painted black and if you didn't know better, you think you're walking into a night club.
I see the bar to my left or at least some lounge area. To my right is reception and I was greeted with smiles to the sushi table. It can be quite a maze as you have to cross through the main dining area which has the same black walls and ceilings decor.
When I arrived at the sushi bar, it is your standard big wooden table with bar seats across. Usually the table would be made from fine wood but I wouldn't know. The furniture does seem to be of good quality and chairs quite comfortable. It is simple and very zen, as with most sushi bars at any reputable Japanese restaurant but something about here just seems too bare and at times I feel like I was eating at an unfinished basement. The dining area is not any better and the blackness of the walls and ceilings make it feel like backstage of an off-Broadway production.
The decor really drags down my experience. Also it felt really stuffy to always have someone in back of you and instructing you on how and what to eat. Not really a lay-back experience. But I get it, it's Omakase and that's how it works. The chef will always announce the dish and you will always have to eat it immediately or you stop his flow.
I feel this really should be a four circles rating and perhaps you should assume that since I'm a bit tired of Omakase. A jaded sushi-foodie, if you will - that's moi. Will I ever have sushi again? Maybe. But not anytime soon.",null,9,0,1,0,0,13 reviews,Satsuki

1587880939-39745,https://en.tripadvisor.com.hk/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d12267006-Reviews-Satsuki-New_York_City_New_York.html,4.5,Japanese,50,50,40,null,$$$$,,"Focused on providing the Japanese equivalent of haute cuisine, also known as Kaiseki Ryori, Satsuki is the renowned omakase sushi bar of the Suzuki Hospitality Group. The group defines Kaiseki Ryori as “the ultimate form of Japanese fine dining experience, expressing season with seasonal dishes,” which a lot of restaurants aim yet hardly succeed to achieve. I chose Satsuki simply because I was craving sushi omakase. Like many of my friends living in NYC for a very limited time of their life, I have a list of restaurants I want to visit before I leave this city, and Satsuki was on the list. I usually find the places on Instagram, where I can see the specific location and pictures of the food and the restaurant at once, and save the captured screen on my phone. Among other several sushi omakase places on my list, I chose Satsuki specifically because when I compared the pictures of the inside of the restaurants, Satsuki seemed to be the most suitable place for solo diners: the table seatings and bar seatings are completely separated, and the entrance is far away from the bar seatings, creating a more intimate ambience between the diners and chefs. 
From a hospitality professional’s perspective, I am a hard customer to please: because of my meticulous personality added to my background as a hospitality student, I have a high, strict set of standards in terms of the quality of service I receive as well as the hospitality experience as a whole. Unlike some people who prioritize the taste of food as the absolute standard of evaluating a restaurant, I prioritize the quality of service, and then comes the taste of food. I am aware of how picky I am, so when I visit a restaurant, I try not to expect anything because I know I will not be pleased easily. My first impression of Satsuki was not different from any other ones: no matter what other people acclaimed about this restaurant, I tried not to create any perception about Satsuki. Going into the restaurant, just like I was going into many other restaurants, I was not hoping for the best experience, but I was hoping it not to be the worst experience. 
“Good evening Miss Kim,” greeted the hostess. To be honest, I was surprised. It is not hard to guess that I am the “Miss Kim” that made a reservation for one person at that time, but not a lot of people have the sense to greet me right at the moment I step my foot into the restaurant. I checked my coat and followed the hostess to my seat. The most distinctively different point of Satsuki in terms of interior design when compared to other sushi places is that Satsuki is very modern. Sushi places tend to keep the interior illumination fairly bright in an attempt to make the fish fresher and to emphasize the traditional Japanese designs and settings. On the other hand, Satsuki maintained its dark setting throughout, and the only bright place within the restaurant was the chef’s area. I had always had a stereotypical image of a Japanese restaurant, where every feature has Oriental details, and encountering the modernism that Satsuki was pursuing was quite sensational. 
The bar seating space had ten seats in total, and two of the seats were already occupied when I entered. To respect the other party’s and my privacy, I was seated at the other end of the bar. The other party seemed to be an old couple, who spoke Japanese fluently and therefore had a free conversation with the chef. I was soon welcomed by the entire staff at the restaurant, including the server and the chef, and given the choice of water and other drinks. The server came back with a cup of green tea that I had ordered, and asked to ensure my food preferences and allergies. When I was making a reservation through text message, I was asked in advance about my food preferences and dietary restrictions - that I do not like clam and uni and that I am allergic to lobster - and the menu I wanted. Satsuki had only two menus: full omakase and half omakase, of which I chose the half omakase, and the server was fully aware of my food preferences, allergies, and the menu I had chosen. These details about me are discussed between me and the restaurant prior to my visit, and I obviously expect the staff to be aware of the details every time I visit a high-end restaurant. However, some restaurants fail to meet my expectations in understanding those details - Satsuki was not one of them. 
The most unique component of an omakase menu is that everything, except for miso soup, is directly served by the chef at the bar, not by the server, and at the time of serving, the chef explains the type of fish, other ingredients used, and how to eat it. As soon as the server brought me my green tea, the chef showed me the fish that were prepared for the day, the freshness and sanitation of which left me speechless. The chef surely showed his knowledge about what he was serving, and in the course of discussing what would best substitute the clam- and uni-based dishes, the ones I specified as my un-likes, he came up with different suggestions based on the day’s freshest fish. His professionalism impressed me, and the consequent confidence added even more taste to the already-delicious sushi. Throughout the whole time, the server came close to me to make sure that my cup is not empty, and every time he saw it was empty, he asked if I wanted it to be refilled. Lastly, by observing the way I dine, the chef noticed that I do not tend to have a personal conversation with anyone other than exchange of information about the food, so he respected my privacy and left me alone, which I appreciated very much. Only towards the very end, he asked where I was from, at what other sushi places in NYC I had ever dined, and how I thought of Satsuki. 
The only minor issue issue I had while I was dining was that the chair I was sitting on was slightly shaking. I noticed that after I started eating, so I decided not to bring it up until I was done eating everything. On my way out, the hostess, handing me back my coat, asked if there was anything they could do to improve, and I finally told her about the shaking chair. After listening, she apologized and promised that the next time I come back, I would not have the same problem. Nonetheless, I was already at an ecstatic state from an amazing meal, so I was not thinking that much about the shaking chair - if the service and food had been bad, I would have made a big deal out of it. 
Having lived in the tristate area for ten years, I visited a myriad of restaurants, and as my personal interest in hospitality grew over time, the focus narrowed down to high-end restaurants. Due to my particularity with service quality and taste as mentioned earlier, I hardly recommend restaurants in New York City to anyone, because nothing really comes to my mind instantly. After my experience at Satsuki, however, Satsuki has established itself as the number one restaurant in my mind. I do not enjoy posting pictures of food or restaurant on Instagram, but I uploaded pictures of the sushi, the interior design, and even the bathroom of Satsuki, because I was that impressed. I truly wish more people visited Satsuki and experienced the state-of-art hospitality. And sushi, too, of course.",null,9,0,1,0,0,13 reviews,Satsuki

The service is phenomenal and they will be on you whenever your glass gets low or your napkin needs refreshing. 
Chef Noz is so creative and there are plenty of wood-fired and charcoaled pieces which just round out the experience. The aged fish is also sublime of course, and really brings the traditional edomae sushi experience to the next level.

You will be charged $300 and change immediately upon making the reservation. This seems weird but then most of these restaurants due to their limited seating will charge your card if you’re a no-show.
From the outside, the architecture is quite traditional. As you go in, you’ll be greeted by greeters in Kimonos and depending on where you sit, the room will look quite traditional and if I didn’t know better, I would think I’m in Japan. It’s quite a transformative experience, that’s for sure, and everything including the food is quite authentic.
However for me, traditional also means really uncomfortable chairs. They had cushions but it didn’t help much as they are quite thin and the chairs quite solid wood. Dining for over two hours in an uncomfortable chair is not really fine dining to me. There is also no music playing in the background so very quiet. You end up hearing other ppl talking though most ppl that night were pretty quiet and so it was a quiet room with a few ppl. I counted around eight chairs.
Once the chef and his assistant comes out, they bow to the customers before starting their master crafted menu. I was fortunate to get Chef Noz himself so quite a special occasion. He seems quite pleasant and courteous but will not hesitate to tell you if you’re eating his sushi the wrong way.
There are good theatrics like showing us this huge bowl of rice and mixing it with soy sauce or showing us a huge piece of Toro or bringing this huge grill out. Definitely, more entertaining than most Omakases but as you eat the food, you realized it’s not just show and this food is amazingly good unlike your local Benihana.

There is a good mix of cooked food and sushi though most of the menu will be sushi. Where other fine Omakases try to experiment by being different, here, the chef just do and does it right. It simply works and is not different for the sake of being different. Dishes like baby octopus on top of diced baby octopus is quite tasty or Toro over riced throughly mixed with Uni. This worked better than a similar dish I had elsewhere where they just served pieces of Toro and Uni over a bowl of rice. The chef here knows what he is doing and all the dishes work. There were no misses as far as I’m concerned.

Service is as you would expect and quite efficient. If you don’t do drink pairing and keep the drinks reasonable, the bill will be what was charged initially with a few dollars more, otherwise expect a large total. There is no tip so that’s always a good thing. Given the quality of food, it’s not overly expensive and I was full afterwards though I couldn’t resist getting ramen nearby since it’s close by to a really good ramen place.

I might come back in the summer to see how the menu changed.",null,8,1,0,0,0,9 reviews,Sushi Noz

We can't resist so we head in. The hostess/waitress seats us at the table top counter along the wall. The place is dark (which I like!), and its us and about 12 other people. It only holds that many.

Desserts (they did bring us one extra dessert to celebrate our anniversary), we uniformly excellent.. They dropped the check without asking us...again...were they trying to turn the table.

Let’s start off by what is right. Landmark building, beautiful lighting & material fit out, friendly staff, mixology and stemware. A+ 
Small adjustments that would go along way: Improved wines and spirit knowledge and enthusiasm by server staff. 
Shortcoming: 
The food: smaller than necessary portions. 25% more food on the plate would justify the premium price points. Flavor and temperature control: razor clam carrots were lukewarm. Placing jalapeños on top of the oysters robs mineral quality and brininess of the oyster. That dish needs to be reconsidered immediately. 
Epic Failure 
The bathroom was strewn with paper towels giving it a sudden Port Authority chic. Hire an attendant to stay on top of tidiness and this problem is easily solved! 
Dessert: Cream puffs while featuring a delectable passion fruit filling were absolutely stale. The cream was liquidy and lacked proper consistency.

The service was slightly laid back but in a very good way. Our waiter was attentive but relaxed, which created an easy atmosphere at the table. Pull apart olive bread with sour cream butter and sea salt, Yea-Delicious. Started with 3 small plates. Gruyere Fritter which are savory in ever sense. They look like churros and my mind wants to eat it expecting sweet cinnamon fried dough but its a savory mindf*ck. Salty gooey melty greyere cheese flows through this buttery-ish pastry. Awesome. The roasted carrot swimming in the razor clam foam, never would i thought clams and carrots but it works. Carrots cooked through with a slight char on the outside. Razor clam broth and foam bring a sea salt/salinity to the earthy charred carrots. Great idea. They honey squash with pomegranate was naturally sweet with that pop of fruit. Great presentations. Entrees were no exception. My friend ordered the Branzino. Roasted and shaved Brussel sprouts and shaved cucumber on to of a center split, 2 filet fresh catch. Cucumber was ever so slightly present which truly elevated the dish. I had the quail over farro. As we know quail is small and easily over cooked, this was a good size and portion and perfectly roasted. The jus was reminiscent of a beef broth but not as bold. Absorbed by the farro which brought its own semi cooked texture and flavors to blend perfectly with the quail. Dessert was honey ice box cake and banana ice cream with caramel popcorn aka craker jacks on top. I commend this restaurant for only serving Australian wines during this time of need. A portion of the wines go to the Koala hospital in NSW and for the Australian Red Cross. I started with a pinot noir from Adelaide Hills called ""The Sabre"", then a McLaren Vale Shiraz labeled Sherrah and finished with The Sticky Stump Jump by d'Arenberg.

The desserts themselves were all very distinct, so offered a great journey through the pastry section's creations. Of course Jungsik's signature mini banana dessert featured along the way. The amount of work and delicate touch both in terms of the actual techniques involved as well as the balance of flavours was evident in each and every dish.
